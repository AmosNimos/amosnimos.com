    Ah, remember the bygone days of the Wild West Web? Back before search engines became our digital overlords, the only way to navigate the information highway was through a network of virtual handshakes.
    This page is an homage to those simpler times. Here you'll find a collection of links I unearthed on my own cyber frontier expeditions.
    Feeling nostalgic for the early days of the internet? Want to see what the web looked like before everyone was obsessed with cats (although there might still be some cats)?
    Here you'll find a collection of links I think are (or were) awesome. Some might still work, some might be like dusty museum exhibits.
    Think of it as a digital flea market - some treasures, some total trash.
    Just remember, the internet moves fast, so these links might be as reliable as a dial-up connection in a thunderstorm.
    This page is basically my internet bookmarks folder come to life... and possibly slightly undead.

    <p>Forget the guessing game! These links are displayed in their full, unedited glory - what you see is what you get. No sneaky redirects, just honest-to-goodness URLs leading you exactly where they say they will. Want to double-check? Feel free to use "inspect element" on any link to confirm. That's transparency at its finest, and something we can all appreciate in the wild world of the web.</p>
