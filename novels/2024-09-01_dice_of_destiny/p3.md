**Page 3: The Reality of Fantasy**

The trek through the forest started out fun enough. The group swapped jokes about being isekai’d and poked fun at the various RPG tropes they were now living. But the longer they walked, the more they began to realize that this wasn't just a game. The breeze felt real, the ground was uneven beneath their feet, and their clothes—itched. 

Ben, still in full Grom the Barbarian mode, was excitedly waving his hands around like a maniac.

Tony, now wearing his character’s rogue gear, glanced over at him, concerned. “Uh, Ben, what are you doing?”

Ben, looking slightly frustrated, replied, “I’m trying to open my stats sheet! You know, like any good RPG. I figured I could just, I dunno, wave my hand or say something like ‘Open Menu’ and boom—there it is. But, nothing’s happening!”

Lisa rolled her eyes, adjusting her mage robes. “Ben, you do realize we’re in a real-world version of the game, right? There’s no ‘menu’ to open. We’re going to have to figure things out the old-fashioned way.”

Sarah, who was now fully embodying her elven ranger persona, sighed. “Great. So, no handy inventory screens or instant spell casting? This just keeps getting better and better.”

As they continued, the forest suddenly seemed a bit more menacing. The shadows grew darker, and the sounds of rustling leaves and distant howls began to echo around them. They stopped in their tracks when they heard a low growl from behind a nearby bush.

“Uh, guys? I think we’ve got company,” Tony whispered, reaching for the dagger at his side. The others immediately got into their combat stances, though it was clear they were more accustomed to rolling dice than actual fighting.

A creature emerged from the bushes—a snarling, wolf-like beast with glowing red eyes and sharp fangs. It was nothing like the little plastic miniatures they were used to pushing around a board. This thing was real, and it looked hungry.

“Alright, it’s go time!” Ben shouted, trying to channel his inner barbarian. He lunged at the beast, swinging his makeshift club. The creature dodged with ease and swiped at Ben’s leg, causing him to stumble backward in pain.

“Gah! What the hell?! I’m supposed to be a level 90 barbarian! Why am I struggling against some low-level monster?” Ben groaned, clutching his leg.

Sarah, who was supposed to be the group’s nimble archer, fumbled with her bow. “Maybe because in real life, you don’t magically inherit all your character’s skills? We’re going to have to actually *learn* how to do this stuff.”

Lisa, frantically flipping through the pages of her mage’s spellbook, muttered under her breath. “Normally, I just say ‘I cast Fireball’ and it’s done! Now I have to find the actual incantation? This is ridiculous!”

The wolf-like creature, sensing their disarray, growled and pounced toward Tony. Tony barely managed to roll out of the way, but not before the beast’s claws grazed his arm, drawing blood.

“Okay, this is officially not fun anymore!” Tony yelped, clutching his arm. “This is supposed to be an adventure, not a horror movie!”

“Focus!” Lisa yelled, finally finding the right spell. She began chanting the incantation, but it was painfully slow, and the creature was closing in fast.

Tony, gritting his teeth, drew his dagger and steeled himself. “We’ve got to work together if we’re going to survive this. Lisa, keep chanting! Ben, get ready to hit it again when it’s distracted!”

The plan was barely coming together when Sarah, finally managing to steady her hands, fired an arrow that landed squarely in the creature’s side. The beast howled in pain, giving Ben the opening he needed. He swung his club with all his might, this time connecting with the creature’s skull. The wolf staggered, and just as it regained its footing, Lisa finished her spell.

“Burn in hell, you overgrown mutt!” she shouted as a bolt of fire shot from her hands, striking the creature and setting it ablaze. The beast let out a final, piercing howl before collapsing into a smoldering heap.

The group stood there, panting, hearts racing. The forest was silent again, save for the crackling of the beast’s burning corpse.

“That... was way more intense than I expected,” Sarah said, lowering her bow.

Ben, still catching his breath, winced as he touched the wound on his leg. “You’re telling me. What’s the point of being OP in the game if we still have to actually know what we’re doing?”

Lisa shook her head, still clutching her spellbook. “This isn’t going to be like the games we’re used to. We might have our characters’ appearances and some abilities, but the rest? We’re going to have to learn the hard way.”

Tony looked at his friends, a mix of fear and determination in his eyes. “So, what now? We head to that town, try to figure out why we’re here, and pray we don’t run into any more of these things?”

Ben grinned, despite the pain. “Well, if we do, I’ll be ready. Practice makes perfect, right?”

As they continued on their journey, the group couldn’t help but wonder what other challenges lay ahead. This was no longer just a game. It was a reality they had to survive, and the only way through was to stick together and face whatever Eldoria threw at them—one unexpected twist at a time.
