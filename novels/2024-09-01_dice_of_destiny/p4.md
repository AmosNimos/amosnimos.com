**Page 3: Spudberry Village**

---

The group moved cautiously through the forest, the leaves crunching under their boots as they headed towards the village. Ben, still in character as Grom, led the way with his new battle axe slung over his shoulder. 

“So, what’s the plan?” Tony asked, glancing nervously around. He kept fingering the wooden d20 in his pocket, the one that had somehow brought them here. “Do we head to Spudberry, sign up with the guild, and start racking up XP?”

“Yeah, that’s the first thing we should do,” Lisa said, flipping through her spellbook. She was already muttering incantations under her breath, trying to memorize the ones she thought would be the most useful. “Plus, we need to figure out what’s going on and why we’re here. Maybe someone in the guild has answers.”

“Well, I’d like to know why none of my spells work unless I actually chant them out loud,” Lisa grumbled. “And why the hell don’t I have a HUD? What kind of RPG doesn’t have a HUD?”

“I’ve been waving my hand around trying to pull up my stats screen for the past ten minutes,” Ben said. “Nothing. Nada. Zilch. This is not how it’s supposed to go.”

“Maybe we need to level up more before we unlock that feature?” Sarah suggested, clearly trying to be optimistic. She adjusted her ranger’s cloak and scanned the area, looking for any threats. “Or maybe we’re missing some kind of tutorial NPC?”

“Speaking of NPCs, I can’t wait to see Sir Puddlefuddles again,” Ben said, smirking. “That pompous little noble with the ridiculous name. We created him as a joke, but now he’s real! This is gonna be hilarious.”

They all burst into laughter at the thought. Back in the real world, they had given some NPCs the silliest, most over-the-top names they could come up with just to make each other laugh. Now, they were about to see these characters in the flesh.

Their laughter faded as they reached the edge of the forest. In the distance, they could see the thatched rooftops of Spudberry Village. The wooden sign at the village entrance proudly proclaimed: *Welcome to Spudberry: Home of the Best Taters in All of Eldoria!*

They made their way into the village, passing stalls selling everything from fresh produce to leather armor. Villagers waved politely, going about their daily business. It looked almost normal, except for the giant billboard near the town square that read: *Join the Adventurer’s Guild Today! Make Gold and Gain Glory!*

“Okay, let’s sign up,” Tony said, leading them toward the guild hall. “We need a plan, and it starts with getting some XP.”

As they approached the guild, Ben couldn’t help but notice a group of knights standing near the entrance. One of them had a crest on his chest—a crest that Ben recognized immediately. He stifled a laugh. It was Sir Puddlefuddles, the pompous noble with a nose that stuck up in the air like he was perpetually smelling something foul.

“Behold!” Sir Puddlefuddles declared in a voice that sounded like he was gargling marbles. “It is I, Sir Puddlefuddles, Protector of Spudberry, Defender of the Potato Fields!”

Ben’s shoulders shook with suppressed laughter. “I can’t— I just can’t,” he wheezed. “This is too good.”

They walked past Sir Puddlefuddles, who was still making grandiose proclamations about the honor of guarding potato fields, and entered the guild hall. The inside was bustling with adventurers of all shapes and sizes. A giant board listed available quests, ranging from goblin hunting to escorting caravans.

Ben spotted the guild receptionist—a tall woman with a serious expression, dressed in elegant armor. Her name tag read: *Florinda Featherbottom*.

“Hello, we’d like to sign up,” Tony said, trying to keep a straight face.

Florinda Featherbottom nodded, handing them forms to fill out. “New adventurers, huh? Well, just sign these waivers, and you’re all set. Remember, Spudberry takes no responsibility for injuries, maiming, or sudden death incurred during questing. Happy adventuring!”

“Sudden death?” Lisa whispered as they filled out their forms. “I thought we were supposed to be overpowered!”

Ben shrugged. “I guess reality is tougher than the game.”

As they turned in their forms, Ben couldn’t help but smile. They might be geeks and nerds who had stumbled into a world they thought they knew everything about, but one thing was clear: this adventure was going to be nothing like what they had expected.
