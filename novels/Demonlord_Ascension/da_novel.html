        <h3>Tutorial Complete, Trial Begins</h3>

        <p>Shiro Kuroda, an ordinary college dropout, finds his time drained by a mind-numbing mobile game: <a class="red" href="https://amosnimos.com/DA/index.html">Demonlord Ascension</a>. The game seems as pointless as they come. You tap endlessly, refining skills with flashy names like "Feral Form" and "Godly Gaze" that—despite their grandeur—do absolutely nothing. Skills level up, more unlock, but the gameplay loop remains utterly hollow. Complaints flood the app store, but for reasons even Shiro can’t quite explain, he keeps playing it. After all it's a way like another to waste time while on the bus or waiting in line.</p>

        <div class="image-section">
            <img src="img/part_one_v2.jpg" alt="Shiro transforms into a demon">
        </div>

        <p>Then, one fateful day, a new feature appears.</p>

        <p>A button labeled "Ascend".</p>

        <p>
        Curiosity piqued, he taps it. A strange popup flickers on his screen—not the usual in-game prompt, but something eerily system-level alert on his smartphone. "Who uses these sort of intrusive popups now days! that game is really trash... idk why the devs released it like that" he taught to him self.
        </p>

        <div class="skills">
            <span>"Warning: Ascending will reset your progress, but your knowledge will carry over to ease your next incarnation. Proceed?"</span>
            <a href="https://amosnimos.com/DA/index.html" class="ascend-button">OK</a>
        </div>

        <p>Lore mumbo jumbo, right? With a shrug, Shiro hits OK.

        Everything goes dark.

        He’s not looking at his phone anymore. He’s not even on Earth.

        Awakening in a New World:

        Shiro awakens in a gloomy forest, shadows stretching in all directions. A burning sensation throbs in his chest. When he stands, words float before his eyes—not unlike the game interface:
        </p>

        <div class="skills">
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Feral Form Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Godly Gaze Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Acheron Apocalypse Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Unleashed Sorrow Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Malevolent Dart Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Ravenous Flesh  Lv.1]</span>
            <span>...</span>
        </div>

        <p>And so on, listing all the hundreds of useless skills he had acquired.</p>

        <div class="image-section">
            <img src="img/part_two.jpg" alt="Shiro transforms into a demon">
        </div>

        <p>"Wow, what! what is this, that can't be real, am I hallucinating? did I hit my head on something?"Looking at his finger they are now red. his body has changed. after some consideration and looking him self in a puddle of water.</p>
        <p>
            He realizes he’s no longer just a human—he’s some sort of demon. (A Demonling, the lowest tier on the evolutionary path to becoming a Demonlord.) "How did this happen, is this because of the game? is this a prank? a publicity stunt maybe?"
        </p>

        <div class="image-section">
            <img src="img/part_three_v2.jpeg" alt="Dark, gloomy forest">
        </div>

        <p>To survive in this brutal world of warring demons, monstrous creatures, and ambitious heroes, he must level up these skills for real. He’s no longer just tapping a screen—every decision could lead to power or death.</p>

        <div class="skills">
            <span>Good luck, Demonlord candidates. Own your skills, prove your might, and you might just become the next <strong class="highlight">Demonlord</strong>. The throne is waiting.<span>

            <h1>Demonlord Ascension: Update</h1>

            <p>Hello, everyone! After some time spent reflecting on my projects, I’ve decided to take a break from actively working on Demonlord Ascension. This decision wasn’t made lightly, as it’s a project close to my heart, but it feels like the right time to step back and let others take the reins if they’re inspired to do so.</p>

            <h2>About Demonlord Ascension</h2>

            <p>Demonlord Ascension is a cool game I’ve been developing using HTML and JavaScript. It’s been a rewarding experience, but I’ve found the format has its limitations for the scope and depth I envisioned for the game. While these limitations haven’t dampened the potential of the game, they’ve influenced my decision to explore new avenues for creativity.</p>

            <h2>Opening the Project to the Community</h2>

            <p>To ensure that Demonlord Ascension doesn’t remain stagnant, I’ll be uploading the code back to the site. This will allow anyone interested to pick up where I left off. If you’ve got ideas, improvements, or even an entirely new direction for the game, feel free to dive in and make it your own. Collaboration and innovation are at the heart of why I’m sharing the project—I’m excited to see where others might take it.</p>

            <h2>Shifting Focus: The Picotron Virtual System</h2>

            <p>Looking ahead, I’m turning my attention to the Picotron virtual system. This platform has intrigued me for a while, and I’m eager to start creating carts and software tailored to it. The constraints and capabilities of Picotron align with my current creative aspirations, and I see it as a space ripe for experimentation and innovation.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

            <p>To everyone who’s supported Demonlord Ascension so far, thank you. Your enthusiasm has meant the world to me, and I hope you’ll continue to follow along as I embark on this new chapter with Picotron. If you do decide to work on Demonlord Ascension, I’d love to hear about your progress and ideas.</p>

            <p>Here’s to new adventures, both in games and beyond!</p>
