        <h1>Demonlord Ascension: Tutorial Completed</h1>

        <p>Shiro Kuroda, an ordinary college dropout, finds his time drained by a mind-numbing mobile game: <a class="red" href="https://amosnimos.com/DA/index.html">Demonlord Ascension</a>. The game seems as pointless as they come. You tap endlessly, refining skills with flashy names like "Feral Form" and "Godly Gaze" that—despite their grandeur—do absolutely nothing. Skills level up, more unlock, but the gameplay loop remains utterly hollow. Complaints flood the app store, but for reasons even Shiro can’t quite explain, he keeps playing it. After all it's a way like another to waste time while on the bus or waiting in line.</p>

        <div class="image-section">
            <img src="img/part_one_v2.jpg" alt="Shiro transforms into a demon">
        </div>

        <p>Then, one fateful day, a new feature appears.</p>

        <p>A button labeled "Ascend".</p>
        <a href="https://amosnimos.com/DA/index.html" class="ascend-button">Ascend</a>
        <p>
        Curiosity piqued, he taps it. A strange popup flickers on his screen—not the usual in-game prompt, but something eerily system-level alert on his smartphone. "Who uses these sort of intrusive popups now days! that game is really trash... idk why the devs released it like that" he taught to him self.
        </p>

        <div class="skills">
            <span>"Warning: Ascending will reset your progress, but your knowledge will carry over to ease your next incarnation. Proceed?"</span>
            <a href="https://amosnimos.com/DA/index.html" class="ascend-button">OK</a>
        </div>

        <p>Lore mumbo jumbo, right? With a shrug, Shiro hits OK.

        Everything goes dark.

        He’s not looking at his phone anymore. He’s not even on Earth.

        Awakening in a New World:

        Shiro awakens in a gloomy forest, shadows stretching in all directions. A burning sensation throbs in his chest. When he stands, words float before his eyes—not unlike the game interface:
        </p>

        <div class="skills">
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Feral Form Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Godly Gaze Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Acheron Apocalypse Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Unleashed Sorrow Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Malevolent Dart Lv.1]</span>
            <span>[Skill Acquired: Ravenous Flesh  Lv.1]</span>
            <span>...</span>
        </div>

        <p>And so on, listing all the hundreds of useless skills he had acquired.</p>

        <div class="image-section">
            <img src="img/part_two.jpg" alt="Shiro transforms into a demon">
        </div>

        <p>"Wow, what! what is this, that can't be real, am I hallucinating? did I hit my head on something?"Looking at his finger they are now red. his body has changed. after some consideration and looking him self in a puddle of water.</p>
        <p>
            He realizes he’s no longer just a human—he’s some sort of demon. (A Demonling, the lowest tier on the evolutionary path to becoming a Demonlord.) "How did this happen, is this because of the game? is this a prank? a publicity stunt maybe?"
        </p>

        <div class="image-section">
            <img src="img/part_three_v2.jpeg" alt="Dark, gloomy forest">
        </div>

        <p>To survive in this brutal world of warring demons, monstrous creatures, and ambitious heroes, he must level up these skills for real. He’s no longer just tapping a screen—every decision could lead to power or death.</p>

        <div class="skills">
            <span>Good luck, Demonlord candidates. Own your skills, prove your might, and you might just become the next <strong class="highlight">Demonlord</strong>. The throne is waiting.<span>
