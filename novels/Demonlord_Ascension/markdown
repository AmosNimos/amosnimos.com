# Demonlord Ascension: A Devlog Update

Hello, everyone! After some time spent reflecting on my projects, I’ve decided to take a break from actively working on Demonlord Ascension. This decision wasn’t made lightly, as it’s a project close to my heart, but it feels like the right time to step back and let others take the reins if they’re inspired to do so.

## About Demonlord Ascension
Demonlord Ascension is a cool game I’ve been developing using HTML and JavaScript. It’s been a rewarding experience, but I’ve found the format has its limitations for the scope and depth I envisioned for the game. While these limitations haven’t dampened the potential of the game, they’ve influenced my decision to explore new avenues for creativity.

## Opening the Project to the Community
To ensure that Demonlord Ascension doesn’t remain stagnant, I’ll be uploading the code back to the site. This will allow anyone interested to pick up where I left off. If you’ve got ideas, improvements, or even an entirely new direction for the game, feel free to dive in and make it your own. Collaboration and innovation are at the heart of why I’m sharing the project—I’m excited to see where others might take it.

## Shifting Focus: The Picotron Virtual System
Looking ahead, I’m turning my attention to the Picotron virtual system. This platform has intrigued me for a while, and I’m eager to start creating carts and software tailored to it. The constraints and capabilities of Picotron align with my current creative aspirations, and I see it as a space ripe for experimentation and innovation.

## Final Thoughts
To everyone who’s supported Demonlord Ascension so far, thank you. Your enthusiasm has meant the world to me, and I hope you’ll continue to follow along as I embark on this new chapter with Picotron. If you do decide to work on Demonlord Ascension, I’d love to hear about your progress and ideas.

Here’s to new adventures, both in games and beyond!
