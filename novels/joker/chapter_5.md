The ring whispered to him, feeding off the chaos that churned within his mind. "Quiet! I can't hear the other voice!" the Joker snapped, his tone somewhere between irritation and delight. The ring’s power was unlike any he had encountered before. It wasn’t fueled by willpower like the Green Lanterns' rings or driven by rage like the Red Lanterns’. No, this ring thrived on something far more unhinged: insanity.

The Joker’s madness wasn’t just fuel—it was the engine, the wheels, and the destination. The Chaos Ring didn’t simply grant power; it made belief into reality. The more deranged the belief, the stronger its effect on existence itself.

Tilting his head, the Joker examined his reflection in the ring's obsidian surface. His grin widened, stretching impossibly as if even his face couldn’t contain his delight.

"Let’s see what kind of fun we can have," he whispered to himself. Then, louder, "Let’s see what this baby can *really* do!"

For a moment, he stood completely still, a predator savoring the silence before the hunt. Then, with a theatrical flourish, he spun in place like a child on a playground, arms outstretched. “Oh, Lanterns, you sweet, naïve fools! Did you think a little prison could hold *me*? A cage? Oh, please. Haven’t you heard? Gravity is optional!”

As if obeying his words, his feet lifted off the ground, and he began to hover, spinning lazily in midair. His laughter echoed through the cell, filling it like a living thing. He looked at the walls around him, saw their solidity as nothing more than a suggestion.

"I said it before, and I’ll say it again—no cell can hold my insanity!" 

He stepped forward as if walking on an invisible staircase. The solid wall before him rippled like water, and with a single step, he passed through it as if it weren’t there. On the other side, alarms blared, lights flashing across the high-security prison.

Kilowog charged down the corridor, his massive frame blotting out the flashing lights. Behind him, Hal Jordan followed, his Green Lantern ring blazing with energy.

Kilowog skidded to a halt as the Joker emerged from the shadows, hovering lazily a few inches off the ground. “Back in your cell, clown!” Kilowog roared, his voice deep and commanding, like a thunderstorm given form.

"My cell?" The Joker grinned, his eyes narrowing with mock consideration. "Hmm, yes, excellent idea, Mr. Oinking Lantern." 

Before Kilowog could respond, the Joker disappeared—no flash, no dramatic exit, just... gone. One moment he was there, and the next, the corridor was empty, save for the echo of his laughter.

Meanwhile, back in Gotham, the Joker appeared in his old cell at Arkham Asylum. The air shimmered as he materialized, reclining casually against the cot. "Ah, home sweet home!" he exclaimed, his voice dripping with mock affection. “Did you miss me, Gotham?”

From the neighboring cell, an irritated voice growled, “Shut up, Joker!”

Across the galaxy, in the Justice League Watchtower, alarms blared. Batman’s fingers flew across the console as he pulled up a report from the Lantern Corps. He frowned as he read the details, his voice low and grim. 

“The Joker has escaped,” he said. “That was faster than I expected.”

Batman: "Alfred, cancel my vacation plans."

Alfred: "I never made them, Master Bruce. I had a feeling something like this would happen."

Superman landed beside him, his red cape billowing as he glanced at the screen. “Escaped? From Oa? That’s impossible.”

Batman’s tone grew even colder as he replayed the footage. It showed the Joker walking through solid walls, laughing as though gravity and reality were mere jokes. “It was impossible,” he said. “But he’s done it. And it gets worse—he has an artifact now. Something the Lanterns are calling the Chaos Ring.”

Superman’s brow furrowed, his jaw tightening. “A ring that bends reality to insanity?” 

Batman nodded. “The more twisted the thought, the more powerful the effect. If anyone could turn that kind of power into a weapon... it’s him.”

Superman straightened. “Then no one is safe.”

“No one,” Batman echoed. “We need to find him. Now.”

As if on cue, a deep rumbling shook Gotham City. Both heroes turned toward the display screen as live footage came in—a towering, twisted spire now loomed in the middle of Gotham, rising high into the stormy sky. The structure defied architecture, a chaotic blend of jagged edges and impossible curves, like a nightmare made solid.

Superman crossed his arms, his expression grim. “Well, that was quick.”
