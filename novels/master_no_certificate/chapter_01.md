**Chapter 1: A Prodigy in the Crowded Circle**

For ten years, Lin Cheng had walked the path of the *doi* alone. While others joined sects, sought mentors, and exchanged their lives for tutelage under renown masters, Lin had turned his free time into mastery. The *doi*, the ancient art of channeling one's chi, was essential for anyone hoping to land a decent job in the imperial army or earn a high-status position in society. For Lin, it had been a hobby—until he realized a hobby wasn't enough to get by in the harsh reality of the empire. Without a sect's attestation, his brilliance was unseen, his talent unrecognized.

The AEC program was his last chance. An *Attestation of Enlightenment and Chi* mastery, it was an expedited course for those who had no other options, like him. To earn a spot in the empire's workforce, he needed this piece of parchment. And so, he found himself every morning in the crowded magical circle, shoulder to shoulder with other hopefuls, traveling for nearly an hour to the **Silver Crescent Sect**.

The sect wasn't prestigious by any means. Most of the students here were like him—those who couldn't afford the time or the gold to attend the legendary sects or had simply failed to gain entry. But unlike Lin, most of them hadn’t already mastered the basics on their own.

On his first day, the head instructor greeted the new students with a stern warning:  
"By decree of the sect elders, the use of Green Dantian Spiritual Stones is forbidden during exams! Any attempt to cheat will result in immediate expulsion."

*Green Dantian Stones?* Lin thought. *Those are for beginners, to barely increase chi flow. How pathetic.*

The first lesson began with simple mantra recitation, one of the foundational techniques to align one's inner chi with the natural forces around them. As the instructor chanted the words of the mantra, the students followed along like newborns learning to walk.

But to Lin, these were little more than incoherent babblings. He had long surpassed these primitive incantations, and it took everything within him not to interrupt, not to correct the instructor's sloppy form, or answer every question posed to the class. The incantations were barely drafts to him, proto-spells. In his decade of self-study, he had refined and created his own mantras, far more intricate and powerful. What they called *basic magical incantations*, he had moved past years ago. 

Yet, here he was, holding his tongue, pretending to be a beginner—because that was what the world demanded. Sect certification trumped true talent. 

His hand twitched at every question, aching to reveal his knowledge, but Lin reminded himself why he was here. He needed the *attestation* to finally prove his worth, even though, in his heart, he already knew he had surpassed this place long ago.
