**Chapter 2: Entering the Shed and Realizing the Truth**

Lin stood at the entrance of what the Silver Crescent Sect referred to as their "secondary pavilion." In truth, the building looked more like a storage shed than a place of ancient learning. Its weathered wooden walls leaned slightly, and the roof, missing a few tiles, barely kept out the elements. There were no grand archways or towering stone statues like the legendary sects had. This was a sect for those with no better options, a place to earn a certificate, nothing more.

He sighed, reminding himself that this was just a formality. He’d spent a decade cultivating by himself in his spare time—more than most students here had likely done under their sect’s guidance. Still, without a sect’s name backing his skills, he was just another face in the crowd.

Inside, the classroom was cramped, filled with eager faces, most probably new to cultivation. The air smelled faintly of incense, likely burned to cover up the mustiness of the old pavilion. A small group of students whispered to each other at the back, one of them boasting confidently, "My friend said we don’t even need to learn cultivation now that we’ve got spiritual stones."

Lin couldn’t help it. He let out a soft *“Ha!”* before catching himself. The student turned, slightly offended, but Lin wasn’t concerned. *Doesn’t he know that spiritual stones are made and maintained by cultivators?* Sure, people without any cultivation could now "use" the *dao* by outsourcing their chi flow through stones, but that didn’t mean the art was obsolete. Far from it. Without cultivators to craft and refine those stones, the system would collapse in weeks.

The instructor entered the room, a middle-aged man with a calm demeanor but eyes that betrayed his lack of real experience. He wore the standard sect robes, though his were frayed at the edges. Lin doubted he had reached anywhere near mastery in the *doi* arts, but he remained silent. *Play the part*, Lin reminded himself. He needed this certificate to survive in this ridiculous system.

Class began with a basic introduction to cultivation—mantras, chi flow, the most elementary of concepts. As the teacher explained, Lin’s mind wandered. The things they were covering today were things he had mastered years ago. *Barely drafts*, he thought. Proto-incantations compared to what he had refined on his own. He could probably teach this class better than the instructor. Each question the teacher posed to the class was met with eager answers from his classmates, but Lin held back. Answering every question would only draw attention, and he had no desire to stand out here. Not yet.

The instructor then began a lesson on the "Art of the 8 Fists," proudly proclaiming it as the first widely-used cultivation technique. Lin’s brow furrowed. *That’s inaccurate*, he thought. The 8 Fists wasn't a cultivation technique at all; it was strictly martial arts, requiring no chi whatsoever. He wasn’t sure if the instructor had misspoken or if he just didn’t know any better, but either way, the information was wrong. Lin had never bothered to practice the technique himself, but a quick glance at one of the scrolls he had written confirmed his knowledge. 

The instructor had mentioned earlier that he was open to feedback, so Lin raised his hand and, in a calm voice, said, “The sect scrolls actually describe the Art of the 8 Fists as a cultivation-less technique.”

The instructor blinked in surprise, then nodded slowly. “Ah, yes, that’s true. Thank you for the clarification.”

Lin could hear some students whispering, but he ignored them. It wasn’t that he wanted to embarrass the teacher; it was just impossible for him to sit quietly and let inaccuracies like that pass. He had dedicated ten years to learning the *doi* on his own. His knowledge, his techniques—his entire understanding of cultivation—was miles beyond this.

As class went on, Lin's eyes flicked toward a young man sitting near the front, dressed in the uniform of an imperial soldier. From overheard conversations, Lin knew the student was enlisted in the army, aiming for a position in the counter-spell division. Supposedly, those in that division studied the weaknesses of incantations to counter them, preventing large-scale magical attacks.

*At least, that’s what they’re told.* Lin knew better. The emperor’s "counter-spell" division wasn’t some noble defensive force. They were special ops, a shadow force used to crush dissent and keep the common folk in line, committing acts of terrorism in the name of maintaining order. The naive student was probably unaware of the horrors he would be asked to commit in the name of the emperor. *Ignorance truly is bliss*, Lin thought.

Class ended, and Lin packed up his things. His first day at the Silver Crescent Sect had gone just as he expected. He had come here to get an attestation, not to learn anything new. Yet already, he found himself correcting the teacher, shaking his head at the shallow knowledge of his peers.

As he left the pavilion, Lin couldn't help but wonder how long he could keep pretending to be just another student before someone realized he was playing a different game entirely.
