<h2 class="title">RSS Feed</h2>
<div class="article">

<h1>RSS Feed Button Explanation:</h1>

<p>The following RSS button leads to my RSS feed XML file. Unlike a typical link that opens a new page, this button's purpose is to provide you with the link to my RSS feed, which you can then add to your RSS feed managing applications, such as Newsboat.</p>

<h2>What is an RSS Feed?</h2>

<p>RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) feeds are a way for websites to distribute their content in a standardized format. They allow you to stay updated on new content from multiple websites without visiting each one individually.</p>

<h2>How to Use RSS Feeds:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>RSS Feed Manager:</strong> Use an RSS feed reader or aggregator app (like Newsboat) to manage and read RSS feeds.</li>
    <li><strong>Adding Feeds:</strong> Copy the link from the RSS button, then paste it into your RSS feed reader's subscription or add-feed option.</li>
    <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> RSS feeds let you follow updates from your favorite sites in one place, ensuring you never miss new articles or updates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Button Doesn't Open a Page:</h2>

<p>The RSS button doesn't open a page directly because its function is to provide the link to the RSS feed file itself. By right-clicking on the button and selecting "Copy link address" (or similar), you can easily obtain the feed URL to add to your RSS feed reader.</p>

<h2>In Summary:</h2>

<p>RSS feeds are a convenient way to track updates from websites you follow, and using an RSS feed reader helps you manage and stay updated on content across multiple sites efficiently.</p>
