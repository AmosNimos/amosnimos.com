Hi whom ever you are, Finding this site is quite an achievement felicitation.
This site was not made with the intent of discussing politics, however things happens and I just kept prioritizing sharing the truth over what I would rather talk about so here we are. 
a some what "Conservative" site on politics and conspiracy... I would rather talk about Linux and bash programming to be honest.
I don't even consider my self on any side of the political spectrum, but society does seem to associate a lot of my value with conservative/republican side of the political spectrum so, let's go with that.
In Canada I used to wonder what imbecile would vote for the Conservative party, I guess people grow, I learn a lot since than, and my perspective has change.  
I am Amos Nimos and this is my site.

I am Canadian and that is all you need to know about me.
I would like to talk about lighter topics, but as I started this blog my country turned into a totalitarian tyranny, so I priories writing about
freedom above all else.
