            <p>Unfortunately, we cannot allow you to play DEI Online.</p>

This is about Equity and Inclusion, so unfortunately, we must exclude you due to your lack of diversity. We can't have individuals like you who refuse to embrace the full spectrum of identities. Please take this time to reflect on your narrow-mindedness and reconsider your place in a truly inclusive world.</p>
            
            <p class="reconsider-message">Please reconsider your integrity and try to be less of a bigot. Until then, we are unable to welcome you.</p>
