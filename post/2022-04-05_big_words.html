When discussing the present issues at hand, on the topics of my country turning into
a hellish, totalitarian, police state, some of my family member, often look at me
as if i am "arrogant" and "pretentious" for using <strong>big</strong> fancy word like "behavioral conditioning", "propaganda" and "unconstitutionally",
and maybe you think the same about my article, but "big event" might require 
"big word" to describe them, i was lucky enough until now to <strong>not</strong> have a use for these words, at least for
the past 23 years or so, 
At least not when speaking about my own country of Canada. 
I was not used to employing words such as "Fascist" or "Nazi"
to describe people actions, because until recently, people action where not the same, or even similar, to the one
of real life Fascist! but things change,
and new context might sometime require employing a more accurate vocabulary. Word that where once uncommon
and hard to employ in concrete situation, are now being used to fulfill their purpose, 
to express the "intricacy" of a constantly changing reality, to vocalize issues and views. 
<br></br>
I am disgusted by the current state of Canada! 
What a shame how it only took one "good"
propaganda campaign, to destroy what was once seen as a "free" country, 
to robe Canadian citizen of their freedom,
Not any freedom, but the same freedom that our Canadian patriots have given their 
life for! My ancestor have fought against the odds, to ensure that <strong>all</strong> Canadians 
would be guaranteed these <strong>fundamental</strong> rights!
<br></br>
It is not a time to be selfish and greedy, the future of our country is at hand!
I personally am currently trapped by all this madness, forced to return to a country that i now fear!
<br></br>
Totalitarian criminal took over Canada, and they are still infiltrated deep
in the highest position of power and authority!
<br></br>
The vast majority of the  governmental system appears to be corrupt,
our system institutions have been compromised from within, 
the Canadian constitution and other fundamental right, 
have been ignored and are actively suppressed! 
<br></br>
We the people, need to fight against the oppressor! 
We need to stand together NOW, we need to defend the victim of 
the current discrimination and abuse!
It is not time to turn against each other, 
it's time to unit and move past our divergent view!
<br></br>
All Canadian should realize that we are in the same team!
it is our future that is at stake, and the future of our descendant! 
<br></br>
We need to protect our fundamental freedom, 
just like our ancestor did for us, 
We need to break the chain of tyranny before it is too late!
<br></br>
We need to stop these incessant "power trip" and "overreach" that these shameless authority keep imposing on us!
They are "public servant" they are suppose to work for us, we are still paying their salary!
