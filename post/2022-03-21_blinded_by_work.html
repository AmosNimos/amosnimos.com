"I would ratter die free, then live as a slave."
A society that cannot be question, is not worth living in.
<br><br/>
No one has time to read, 
next no one has time to question, 
then no one as time to think. 
Finally no one has time to be free. 
<br><br/>
I have seen good innocent citizen thrown in jail, 
while criminal known to be guilty where kept outside of it.
<br><br/>
You most probably have not heard about these cases.
For example a lot of entertainers/reporters from the Canadian province of Quebec are getting arrested and treated worst then criminal, all so that they would promise, and agree to stay silent and stop posting on social media.
Where is free speech for <del>Francois Amelaga</del> and <del>Steeve "l'artiss" Charland</del>? These people had a following online that witnessed how they where treated,
but what about casual citizen, how many where treated like that?
<br><br/>
Their is probably a lot of people who got arrested simply for not wearing the useless face covers, 
would we know about all of them?
People loosing their job simply for not taking the fake vaccine that could "potentially" kill them, where is the justice for them?
<br><br/>
I hope you see how this new world of illusion lead to mass delusion!
How this is not normal, and should not be seen as such.
This is tyranny, i have even seen some media like <del>CNN</del> try to discredit those
who identify them self as <del>pro-choice</del>, freedom as almost become a swear word.
<br><br/>
People are too busy working to care about the state of the world, to protect their future, to defend their right.
<br><br/>
People spend a lot of time working, just to
be able to afford the always expending expenses of life.
This is by no mean an accident, it is by design.
If this was not enough, <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-news/pages/remote-employees-are-working-longer-than-before.aspx">research shows remote employees are working longer</a>!

<br><br/>
Since the rise of dual income family around 1976
people are force to have two salary to be able to afford a decent living, 
and even with two salary many still struggle, this ain't normal!
<br><br/>
One of the biggest expenses in some country are the varied governments taxes, that are dispersed in every aspect of their citizen life, and for what in return? corrupt politician who always take more and do less?
Political lobbying <strong>is</strong> corruption, yet no one care, that is how politician play with word to shape our perception of reality.
<br><br/> 
When the peasants are busy working on the crops, they do not have the time to question those in power.
Even if they did have the time, they would no longer have the strength to revolt.
<br><br/>
This is how those in power want us to be, constantly distracted by work.
When we have some free time, they want us to spend it constantly distracted by the media.
Your job, do not even need to be productive for society, it can be meaningless work, 
it just need to keep you busy, too busy to care about the detail of politics.
such as knowing who are in power, and what they are actually doing with their power.
<br><br/>
People are enslaved by their work, and even more if they are student.
You must know that our society is so filled with brainwashing, 
propaganda and other tactics of behavioral reprogramming, 
that just like the fish with water, we are so surrounded by it, that we no longer notice it.
<br><br/>
Even if you knew that the people in power where doing something bad, "what can we do?"
That is exactly what they want us to tell our self, this is the mindset every master want
his servant to have.
<br><br/>
Those in power want us the people disarmed, passive and harmless.
<br><br/>
To avoid rebellion they will contently try to divide us, to turn us against one another,
they will make sure that as a whole, the people are busy fighting among themselves.
they will create different faction, different treat all to distract and occupy our mind.
<br><br/>
It is the same old tactics of divide and conquer.
<br><br/>
You might not watch media like the TV, the news paper, Netflix, not even YouTube, you might
not even use the internet and yet, you might still be within what I like to call the media matrix.
<br><br/>
How? Trough your environment! If the people you are with, are expose to the media matrix, <strong>so are you</strong>,
It is natural to take the side of our friends, family and peers, to integrate some of their
belief, even if they could be biased, even if they might have been lied to, even if their position is irrational, even if the view in question, where implanted by the media, we slowly adopt some of their view and argument, making small ideological compromise. This is how the reach of the media matrix expand outside of the media them self.
<br><br/>
Recently reality have been so outlandish that no one believed it.
When i say to people what is going on, they assume that what i am talking about is some
obscure hidden information, but NO! it's out their! yes it is heavily censored on most
<strong>mainstream</strong> platform, but their is still enough under the sun,
to get the just of the situation.
If you only take the time to read their book, their conspiracy become more visible.
Their is more to see, in what you don't see, then what is shown to you.
<br><br/>
Alternative platform are more important then ever, everyday i see videos disappears,
for showing what the big platforms want to hide, i see comments being
erased without warning, just for sharing information the big platform want to hide. i see
account being terminated just for pointing out what the big platform want to hide.
<br><br/>
All i can tell you for sure is that, their is <strong>a lot</strong> they want to hide.
