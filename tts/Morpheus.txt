 Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something, what you know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You've probably felt it your entire life.

That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there... like a splinter in you're mind, driving you mad. It is probably this feeling that has brought you here. Do you know what I'm talking about? Do you want to know.... what it is....?

The Media Matrix is everywhere. It's all around us, even in this very moment. You can see it when you open window or when you turn on your television. You can feel when you search google, or post on Facebook. The Media Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes, to blind you from the truth...

That you are a slave. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell, taste or touch. A prison...for your mind! Unfortunately, no one can be... told what the truth is... you have to see it for yourself.

Remember... all I'm offering you is the truth nothing more, nothing less.
