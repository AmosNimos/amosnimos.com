        <ol>
            <li><strong>Primary Fermentation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mix 3 liters of Canada Dry with 1 kg of honey in a large sanitized fermentation container.</li>
                    <li>Add the juice and slices of 1 lemon.</li>
                    <li>Add 100 grams of sliced dry raisins.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 can (250 ml) of Guru energy drink or Red Bull.</li>
                    <li>Add a small handful of washed and sanitized pine needles.</li>
                    <li>Stir well to combine all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 packet (7 grams) of bread yeast, ensuring it's well mixed.</li>
                    <li>Cover the container with an airlock and let it ferment in a dark place at room temperature for about 2-4 weeks, until fermentation slows down significantly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Fermentation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>After primary fermentation, rack (transfer) the mead into a clean container, leaving the sediment and pine needles behind.</li>
                    <li>Add 250 ml of corn syrup to the mead.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 kg of white sugar to increase sweetness (adjust to taste if necessary).</li>
                    <li>Stir gently to dissolve the added sugar and corn syrup.</li>
                    <li>Let the mead sit for another week or two for secondary fermentation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Post-Fermentation Additions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>After secondary fermentation is complete, add 2 drops of blue food dye and 1 drop of vanilla extract to the mead.</li>
                    <li>Stir gently to ensure even distribution.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bottling:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once fermentation is completely done and post-fermentation additions are made, bottle the mead.</li>
                    <li>Ensure the bottles are sanitized and sealed properly.</li>
                    <li>Let the bottled mead age for at least a month to mellow the flavors.</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sweetness:</strong> Since you want it very sweet, like Palm Bay or poppers, the additional sugar after fermentation will help achieve that. Adjust the amount if you find it too sweet or not sweet enough.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbonation:</strong> If you prefer a carbonated mead, you can prime it with a bit more sugar before bottling. However, be cautious to avoid over-carbonation, which can cause bottles to explode.</li>
            <li><strong>Aging:</strong> The longer you let it age after bottling, the better the flavors will blend. A few months to a year can make a significant difference.</li>
            <li><strong>Pine Needles:</strong> Ensure the pine needles are from a safe, edible species like Eastern White Pine. Avoid any pine that may be toxic.</li>
