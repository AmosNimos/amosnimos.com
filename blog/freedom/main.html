	My Books Recommendation:
	(Mainly: Fantasy, Fiction, Xianxia, Isekai, Political, Dystopian, Sci-fi, Social Science)
	These are "books" recommendation first and foremost, if an audio book adaptation is available,
	feel free to listen to it instead of reading them, but I do suggest you start with the novel version,
	audio or written (if available), before you look at the other adaptation such as movie and series.

	As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance and automate various industries, there is a growing concern that it will lead to widespread job displacement. In response, some proponents of universal basic income (UBI) argue that providing a guaranteed income for all citizens would allow individuals to pursue education and training to adapt to the changing economy, as well as provide a safety net in the face of job loss due to automation. However, implementing UBI also carries the risk of creating dependency on government assistance, which could potentially limit the freedom of individuals to make their own choices and decisions about their careers and livelihoods. It is important for policy makers to carefully consider the potential consequences of UBI in terms of both its potential benefits and potential drawbacks, and to approach the implementation of UBI with caution.
	<br>
	It is possible that a government could decide to link access to universal basic income with compliance with certain mandates or policies. However, such a decision would likely raise significant ethical and legal concerns, as it could be seen as coercing individuals into complying with certain mandates or policies by withholding a basic necessity such as income.
	<br>
	There may also be practical challenges to enforcing such a policy, as it could be difficult to determine whether an individual is in compliance with a particular mandate or policy. Additionally, linking access to universal basic income with compliance with certain mandates or policies could create inequities, as it could disproportionately affect marginalized or disadvantaged groups who may have more difficulty complying with such mandates or policies.
	<br>
	Overall, it is important for governments to consider the potential consequences of linking access to universal basic income with compliance with certain mandates or policies, and to approach such decisions with care and caution.
	<br>
	Linking access to universal basic income with compliance with certain mandates or policies could potentially be seen as reminiscent of an Orwellian dystopia, in which the government exerts excessive control over the lives and actions of its citizens. Such a policy could be seen as a form of tyranny or totalitarianism, as it could restrict the freedom and autonomy of individuals in order to achieve certain policy goals.
	<br>
	In an Orwellian dystopia, the government may use various methods of control and surveillance to enforce compliance with its policies, including the use of a police state to monitor and punish those who do not comply. While linking access to universal basic income with compliance with certain mandates or policies may not necessarily involve the same level of control and surveillance as an Orwellian dystopia, it could still be seen as a form of coercion that may be perceived as oppressive by some individuals.
	<br>
	It is important for governments to be mindful of the potential consequences of linking access to universal basic income with compliance with certain mandates or policies, and to approach such policies with caution in order to avoid creating an atmosphere of tyranny or totalitarianism. Governments should strive to ensure that their policies respect the freedom and autonomy of their citizens, and should consider alternative approaches to achieving policy goals that do not involve the use of coercion or control.
	<br>
	If you are concerned about the potential consequences of linking access to universal basic income with compliance with certain mandates or policies, here are a few things you can do:
	<br>
	    Educate yourself: It is important to understand the issues and potential consequences of such policies in order to make informed decisions and advocate for change. Read up on the topic and seek out a variety of perspectives.
	<br>
	    Engage in dialogue: Participate in discussions with others who may have different viewpoints on the issue. Engaging in respectful and open-minded dialogue can help build understanding and find common ground.
	<br>
	    Advocate for change: If you believe that linking access to universal basic income with compliance with certain mandates or policies is not a fair or effective approach, consider advocating for change. This could involve writing to your elected representatives, participating in grassroots campaigns, or supporting organizations that are working on this issue.
	<br>
	    Consider alternative approaches: If you are involved in policy-making or advocacy, consider proposing alternative approaches to achieving policy goals that do not involve the use of coercion or control. This could include providing education and support to help individuals comply with mandates or policies, rather than using incentives or disincentives.

	This week, I was fortunate enough to accomplish a few things that I am quite proud of. I wrote two books, "Arandel" and "The Tome of Eternal Darkness," and I have started working on a third one. I also developed a new social media site called "picpic.cloud" which is still in the process of being developed and expanded. In addition, I programmed a custom virtual assistant that runs on my computer, which is currently tasked with reminding me to do other productive activities and to not stay at the computer for too long. However, I have big plans to integrate AI into the assistant in the future to make it even more life-like and capable of performing more complex tasks.
	<br>
	I am grateful for the opportunities that have come my way and hope to continue learning and growing in the future."
