Street Tags: An Ignorant Act of Vandalism Compared to Old School Graffiti
</p><p>
Street tags, those poorly drawn scribbles made with graffiti pens, are a form of vandalism that contribute to the degradation of our communities. They are the work of individuals who have no respect for public property, no regard for their community, and no appreciation for the consequences of their actions.
</p><p>
Compared to old school graffiti, which was often a form of art and required time, effort, and skill, street tags are nothing but a cheap imitation. Old school graffiti, while still illegal, was often found in remote and abandoned areas, or in places that people rarely went. It was a form of expression that required creativity, patience, and skill. Some of the graffiti works were even considered masterpieces.
</p><p>
On the other hand, street tags are made quickly and haphazardly, with little thought given to the design or color choices. They can be found everywhere, from public transportation to community buildings, and they make our neighborhoods look neglected and run down.
</p><p>
It's time for those who make these tags to realize that their actions have real consequences. Cleaning up these tags requires time, effort, and money, which all come from the taxpayers' pockets. In essence, these vandals are tagging everyone's homes and forcing everyone to pay for their senseless acts of destruction.
</p><p>
What kind of person would do such a thing? A person who is ignorant of the impact of their actions on their community, a person who has no sense of responsibility or ownership for their surroundings, and a person who lacks the creativity and skill to create something positive and productive.
</p><p>
It's time for these individuals to realize that their actions have real consequences and to channel their energy into more positive and productive activities that benefit themselves and their communities. They could volunteer in local clean-up efforts or contribute to community art projects. These activities not only help to beautify the community but also provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.
</p><p>
In conclusion, street tags are an ignorant act of vandalism that contribute nothing to our communities. We should encourage everyone to channel their energy into more positive and productive activities that will benefit themselves and their communities. Only then can we hope to see a change in the way we treat our public spaces.
