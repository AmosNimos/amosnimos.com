As technology advances at an unprecedented pace, there is a growing concern that it is being misused to create a dystopian future. The potential for a totalitarian regime to emerge, fueled by the unchecked power of technology, is a clear and present danger.
</p><p>
If things continue down this path, we will be living in a world where our every move is monitored, our every thought tracked, and our every action dictated by an oppressive government that values control over freedom. The very essence of humanity will be stripped away, and we will become nothing more than cogs in a soulless machine. That is assuming that we are not already.
</p><p>
As this nightmare looms ever closer, the only hope for escape may lie in becoming a cyberpunk. Using technology to fight back against the forces of oppression, we may be able to carve out a path to freedom, even in the midst of a technological prison society. Not to restrict the freedoms of others, but instead to regain the fundamental freedoms we once had as individuals.
</p><p>
But the question remains: will we have the courage and ingenuity to break free from our chains, or will we be doomed to a lifetime of servitude to the all-powerful machines that we ourselves have created? Only time will tell.
</p><p>
Every day, our movements are tracked, our purchases logged, our searches saved, and our faces scanned. Facial recognition technology is becoming increasingly widespread, with 24 countries already implementing location tracking to ensure compliance with quarantines. Even increased facemask usage is not protecting our privacy, as China's facial recognition algorithms have already figured out a way around them.
</p>
<p>
The recent partnership between Canada's federal government and the World Economic Forum (WEF) to create a new digital ID program, the Known Traveller Digital Identity (KTDI), raises concerns about increased government surveillance and potential infringement upon individual freedoms. While the program is intended to streamline passenger travel and confirm identity and citizenship status, it could be misused to further restrict movement and even pave the way for social credit systems, as seen in Communist China's totalitarian government. This development highlights the importance of pushing back against globalist initiatives that erode privacy and individual rights, and further underscores the need for cyber punks to use technology to fight back against oppressive forces and reclaim fundamental freedoms.
</p>
<p>
This is a warning that if the digital ID program gains traction, it could potentially turn Canada into a full-blown totalitarian police state. Unfortunately, this warning is not limited to Canada as similar programs are being implemented globally, leading to the erosion of fundamental rights and freedoms. Are we already living in a tyrannical and totalitarian world? It begs the question of whether there is any escape left for those seeking to preserve individual freedom.

In January 2020, the New York Times reported that Clearview AI had created a database that made it possible to snap a photo of a stranger and reveal that person's identity. The technology was developed using over three billion images scraped from public social media accounts. Anti-immigration alt-right political operatives collaborated with the Australian creator of the technology, Hoan Ton-that. Elements of Clearview AI are in use by over 600 law enforcement agencies in North America, including the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and ICE.
</p><p>
The worry about extrajudicial use of personal data is less far-fetched than ever, especially in the age of coronavirus lockdowns. The Department of Justice has requested Congress pass a law to allow indefinite detention without trial of US citizens during national emergencies. Unauthorized movements picked up by surveillance could be a pretext for such indefinite detention. Privacy rights need to be more emphasized, and any data collected about individuals must have a warrant before being used.
</p><p>
Some designers, and cybersecurity experts, are trying to fight surveillance with "fashion". Using surveillance-resistant clothing such as masks meant to block facial recognition cameras. Other anti-surveillance designers use fashion as a form of obstruction marketing makeup products or glasses.
</p><p>
While these efforts are commendable, people should not have to wear a mask or put on face paint or wear complicated t-shirt patterns to protect their privacy. The government should be protecting our privacy, and the power structures, as they are, should be valuing our privacy.
</p><p>
The reality is that the technological prison is inevitable, and living as a "cyberpunk" using technology to combat misused technology might be the only path to freedom to escape a dystopian future. We need to resist the surveillance society, and our government should be protecting our privacy.
</p><p>
The transhumanist movement is more than just a fringe idea - it's a potentially terrifying one. Their goal is to modify the human body and experience with technology, but what does that really mean? Imagine a world where implanted RFID chips are the norm, just to access basic services. It might sound like science fiction, but it's not that far off.
</p><p>
Their ideas are often sold as innovative solutions to major problems. Facial recognition and AI surveillance can be used to prevent terrorist attacks or fight human trafficking. These sound like noble causes, but the truth is that no amount of technology can eliminate corruption or guarantee safety.
</p><p>
The idea that we can trust governments and corporations with such powerful tools is a dangerous one. It's easy to get swept up in the hype of progress and forget the lessons of history. If tyrants of the past had access to today's technology, the world would be a very different - and likely worse - place. We must be cautious and critical of these "innovations" and remember that with great power comes great responsibility.
