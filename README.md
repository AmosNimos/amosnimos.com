<h1>Welcome to Amos Nimos' Personal Blog</h1>
<p>The amosnimos.com repository is a collection of source code for a website that explored the concept of freedom from a "republican conservative" perspective. As a Canadian, the author tackled a wide range of topics, including the mass induced psychosis that occurred following events like the COVID crisis, government propaganda, herd mentality, bias, corruption, and politics. The site discussed the restrictions and mandates during the crisis, as well as the rise of totalitarianism around the world.</p>
<p>Drawing on sociology and psychology, the website analyzed current events with the aim of providing readers with an alternative perspective to mainstream media. While the site may be reminiscent of info-wars, it operates without the same budget or popularity. Rather, it seeks to inform readers about important issues that are often overlooked in mainstream discourse. With the publication of the source code on GitHub, the author hopes that others will be able to learn from and build upon the work that has been done.</p>
