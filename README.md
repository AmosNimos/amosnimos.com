<h1>Welcome to Amos Nimos Personal Blog</h1>
<p>The amosnimos.com repository hosts the source code for a website dedicated to the principles of digital freedom and decentralization. In an era of increasing centralization and control, this site champions a free and open web, where no single entity holds dominion over the flow of information.</p>
<p>As a Canadian exploring a diverse array of topics, the website delves into societal issues, including responses to crises, government transparency, and the impact of digital monopolies. It aims to foster independent thought and encourage users to navigate a web that remains an open, decentralized network of interconnected ideas.</p>
<p>The website operates without reliance on external services that may compromise user autonomy or introduce security risks. It is a testament to the belief that the web should be a network of free and diverse "islands," connected by bridges of open access and mutual respect.</p>
<p>Source code is available for anyone interested in contributing to or learning from this effort. Posts can be found in the <code>/post</code> directory, while stylesheets are in <code>/css</code>, and images in <code>/img</code>. The <code>about.html</code> file provides background on the site, and <code>index.html</code> serves as the main entry point.</p>
<p>The <code>/draft</code> directory contains incomplete drafts and can be disregarded.</p>
<p>All content is licensed under the MIT License, affirming my commitment to an open and collaborative web.</p>
<p>This website doth serve as a template and a testament to the noble spirit of a libre and independent webâ€”an edifice unchained from the grasp of vast corporations and unbounded by the stifling uniformity of mainstream digital dominion. It stands as a bastion of untrammeled creativity and unyielding ideology, where innovation doth flow unrestrained and free. This site is a living relic of the decentralized ethos of the web, a realm where diverse voices and visions may flourish uncorrupted by the encroaching shadows of monolithic powers.</p>
