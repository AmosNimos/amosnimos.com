Demon general unloking trough progression. (How about you unlock generals based on your reincarnation level, so if you are reicarnation level 3 you cannot unlock the general of level 4 (that is unlock when the player reach level 10 for example. even if you keep grinding))
each general give you 1 special powers.

General power: 
0. Have a chance to do double the damage (critical hit)
1. Ability to cast all available skills at once.
2. Ability to train all available skills at once.
3. Auto cast 1 selected skill.
4. Auto cast 2 selected skill.
5. Auto cast 3 selected skill. 
6. reduce cooldown by half for skills above level 10.
7. Double the gold reward half the time.


dayli and/or weekly quest

Unlock Hellish realm reduce all cooldown by some %.

Add an image/animation for the reincarnation the demonlord raising from the grave.
Add a shop where you can buy items that reduce cooldown specefic skills or increase the gold earned, increase chance of critical hit?? (have a cool critical hit animation.)
Add a wave system where when you start a battle you have x time to defeat all enemy before they reach your castle. see them marching and have to act quick.
Have max level for spell. make sens... maybe have item that could increase them.
How about limiting how many active spell slots their are, having to swap them but you can't swap a spell that is in use.
I like the strategy that might add, but it might break what makes the game fun (having access to all your spell and being able to spam them.)
