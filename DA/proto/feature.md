2 colors of balls
inside a battle area (canvas) on the page.
The canvas is at the center of the page has a border.
bellow the canvas you have a start battle button that start the battle.
the balls of the same color repulse each other, balls of different color attract each other.
when two balls of different color colide you make them and the balls around get a repulsed from the colision point. like a showave or push back, you have the two initial ball that colided bounce away from each other. the goal is to show the force of the impact.
when balls of different color colide they flash white.
while ball flash they are not affected by other balls position.
every balls has HP representing it's durability. (how many impact it can take)
default HP is 10. so each ball can collide with a ball of the oposing color 10 times before getting removed from the game.
when all ball of one color are removed the oposite team win.
at the start every ball velocity is set to move toward the oposite side.
max velocity for the balls of 2
min velocity of 1 for the balls
