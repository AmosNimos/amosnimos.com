"Industrial Society and it's future (The Unabomber Manifesto)"
A controversial book, that has some valid arguments, on some of the 
systemic issues of our modern society.
<br></br>
I was first introduced to this book 
in a video by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luck Smith</a>
a while ago.
<br></br>
The origin of the book it self, is interesting on it's own,
but this article will focus as much as possible on the 
content of the work it self.
<br></br>
This book has good explanations of what is the modern
political LEFT, how it operates, and what are it's driving 
motives.
<br></br>
The author of the book 
developed a reasoning for the modern leftist
mentality, and decipher how 
the modern leftist ideology 
is fundamentally toxic and hypocritical.
<br></br>
I think that if one feel insulted or triggered by this work,
this person prove the point, that the book is making.
<br></br>
A lot of the general conclusion in this book 
are almost prophetic, by how accurate they are,
and how well they can be use to demystify 
current event. 
<br></br>
My highlights from the book:
<ol>
<li>
Those who are most sensitive about "politically incorrect"
terminology are not the average black ghetto-dweller, Asian
immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority
of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any "oppressed"
group but come from privileged strata of society.
</li></br>

<li>
The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist.
He wants society to solve everyone's problems for them,
satisfy everyone's needs for them, take care of them.
</li></br>

<li>
modern leftish philosopher tend to dismiss reason, science, 
objective reality, and to insist that everything is culturally 
relative.
</li></br>

<li>
The leftist hate science and rationality, because they classify certain beliefs
as true (i.e. successful, superior) and other beliefs as false
(i.e failed, inferior). The leftist's feelings of inferiority
run so deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some 
things as successful or superior and other things as failed or
inferior. This also underlies the rejection by many leftists of
the concept of mental illness.
</li></br>

<li>
Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations
of human abilities or behavior because such explanations 
tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to others. 
Leftists prefer to give a society the credit or blame for an
individual's ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is "inferior"
it is not his fault, but society's, because he has not been 
brought up properly.
</li></br>

<li>
Much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated 
to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying
to help.
</li></br>

<li>
We are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates
somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself
or not.
</li></br>

<li>
The oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt,
thought or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality;
he cannot think...
</li></br>

<li>
If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting 
against racism or the like.
</li></br>
</ol>
Observation of the highlight n.10 (footnote): 
Even if the side they are fighting,
is not racism or the like, they will pretend it is,
and use baseless accusation, bias logic,  
as evidence to justify their attack. 
<br></br>
We have seen a lot of the toxic leftism describe in
this book in modern
movements "The woke", "SJW", "BLM", "Antifa" comes to mind,
some of these movements might have been started with good 
intention, but the end result is the same.
<br></br>
Every request past a state of equality is a request for inequality.
The one who keep demanding more after equality is 
reach is abusing. Once the balance restored, any more push
in the same direction, will only tip it the other way.
<br></br>
when the process needs to be unfair to produce equality 
in the result, then what you have is an unjust society.
<br></br>
No society is more unjust, then one where everyone is equal.
<br></br>
Outside of the meritocracy, their is only reward for 
the undeserving.
<br></br>
I have seen the hypocrisy of the left, the irony of their actions, 
how the modern left is deluded and idealistic, how their plan for a "better future" 
only bring us closer to chaos and inequality.
<br></br>
I think that no matter what we 
can think of the radical actions of the author, 
we should not dismiss some of the wise argument he 
made in his book.
<br></br>
