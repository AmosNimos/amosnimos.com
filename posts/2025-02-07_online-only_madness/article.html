<strong>Canadaâ€™s Online-Only Madness: Why Are We Forced to Do Everything on the Internet?</strong>

What in the <strong>actual hell</strong> is going on in Canada? You need a job, so you put on decent clothes, walk into a business, and politely ask to submit your resume. What do they say? <strong>"Apply online."</strong> You want to sign up for a gym, <strong>in person</strong>, at the front desk, where the staff is literally paid to handle memberships. What do they say? <strong>"Go fill out the form online."</strong>  
</p><p>
Are we serious? Are we actually saying <strong>you must have</strong> a smartphone, a computer, and internet access to do the most basic things? This isnâ€™t just inconvenient, itâ€™s a <strong>trap</strong>. Not everyone has unlimited data, a working laptop, or time to fight with some broken, convoluted online form that probably doesnâ€™t even load properly.  
</p><p>
And letâ€™s talk about jobs for a second. If youâ€™re hiring people who <strong>wonâ€™t even bother coming in person to apply</strong>, what makes you think theyâ€™ll bother <strong>showing up to work on time</strong>? The absolute <strong>bare minimum</strong> for a job is showing up, and weâ€™re removing that from the process entirely. <strong>Who benefits from this?</strong>  
</p><p>
This isnâ€™t about <strong>convenience</strong>, itâ€™s about <strong>forcing people</strong> into a digital system that not everyone wants or can access. Itâ€™s a lazy excuse to <strong>replace human interaction with a broken, frustrating, impersonal process</strong>. If Iâ€™m standing in front of you, <strong>ready to sign up, pay, or hand you my resume</strong>, there is absolutely <strong>zero reason</strong> to send me home to fight with a glitchy website.  
</p><p>
This online-only nonsense is <strong>idiocracy in action</strong>. We need to push back, because this isnâ€™t just about technology, itâ€™s about <strong>basic accessibility and common sense</strong>. If a human can help, <strong>let them help</strong>. Stop treating everything like it has to be done through a damn screen.
</p>
<p>This is more than just inconvenience, itâ€™s about the right to technological impairment. Not everyone is tech-savvy, and no one should be forced into a digital system just to function in society. This is a Virtual Insanity, where technology is supposed to help but instead becomes an obstacle. The real problem isnâ€™t technology itself, I love tech when itâ€™s a tool that improves life. But what we have now is tech being used against us, making things harder, isolating people, and punishing those without constant internet access. This isnâ€™t progress, itâ€™s dystopian nonsense, and itâ€™s hitting customers and workers the hardest.
