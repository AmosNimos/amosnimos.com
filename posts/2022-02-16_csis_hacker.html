	<p>"We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of." &ndash; Edward Bernays in Propaganda</p>
	<p>Since 2019 the "Canadian Secret Intelligence Services" (CSIS) Canada domestic spy agency is in the market for hackers.</p>
	<p>The successful candidate will be expected to build new tools for the spy agency to carry out electronic snooping, develop and maintain a database of <mark>malware and exploits</mark>, according to the job posting.</p>

	<p>On their site they say "Cyber security professionals within the government of Canada play a critical role protecting our citizens, economy and democracy."</p>
	<p>But in the context of the recent (Suspicious) cyber attack against GiveSendGo "Freedom Convoy" donation page.</p>

	<p>In the context of the Canadian government previous dictatorial measures, tyrannical response and criminal action, including: directly being responsible for pressuring the shutdown and attempting to seizes the funds of a similar fundraising page on the GoFundMe website, which promptly complied following the authority pressure.</p>
	<p>It make me wonder if they don't mean "Cyber security professionals within the government of Canada play a critical role <mark>attacking</mark> our citizens, economy and democracy". With all this power and secrecy, what prevent these secret organisations, from using this power, against the same citizen they are supposed to serve and protect?</p>
	<p>Will their be a Canadian Edward Snowden to warn us if such institution betray our trust, or will it just happen in the shadow without the population ever knowing?</p>
	<p>"The NSA spying on the American people must end now. The CIA must finally be broken up" &ndash; John F. Kennedey swore in a promise that cost him his life.</p>
	<p>Could this wisdom apply to the Canadian secret organisations?</p>
