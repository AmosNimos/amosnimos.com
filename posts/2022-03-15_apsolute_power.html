<p>
In recent years the tyrant in power have use <del>COVID-19</del> to attack our most basic freedom,
most specifically the freedom of speech. 
<br><br/>
Online <del>censorship</del> has already surpassed the prediction of the 
most darkest dystopian science fiction out their.
<br><br/>
Mean while the government around the world tryed their best at destroying net neutrality,
at removing free speech from the web, they use "misinformation" as an excuse to <del>censor</del>
information they dislike, this is government overreach! Government 
should never under no circumstance have these kind of power, not more in the real world then in
the virtual one!
<br><br/> 
“Absolute power corrupts absolutely” 
means that whenever a person has power over other people or things, it makes him/her corrupt
<br><br/>
Will this blog be considered misinformation? At the moment of this blog writing 
the Canadian government is talking about passing <strong>Bill C-11</strong> 
which would grant the government the absolute power over Canadian internet.
<a href="https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/en/bill/43-2/C-11">Info on C-11 (43-2)</a>
<br><br/>
French Canadian people already have limited option when it come to source of information they
can access, imagine if their government start hiding thing from them, because that is what this
is, this is information being hidden from the people, by the government, "for their own good".
<br><br/>
Now that the excuse of <del>COVID-19</del> start to loose it's power, they use the Ukraine/Russia 
conflict to justify their action.

<h3>The Wolf and The Lamb</h3>
From the Fables of Aesop 
<blockquote cite="https://read.gov/aesop/063.html">
A stray Lamb stood drinking early one morning on the bank of a woodland stream. That very same morning a hungry Wolf came by farther up the stream, hunting for something to eat. He soon got his eyes on the Lamb. As a rule Mr. Wolf snapped up such delicious morsels without making any bones about it, but this Lamb looked so very helpless and innocent that the Wolf felt he ought to have some kind of an excuse for taking its life.
<br><br/>
"How dare you paddle around in my stream and stir up all the mud!" he shouted fiercely. "You deserve to be punished severely for your rashness!"
<br><br/>
"But, your highness," replied the trembling Lamb, "do not be angry! I cannot possibly muddy the water you are drinking up there. Remember, you are upstream and I am downstream."
<br><br/>
"You do muddy it!" retorted the Wolf savagely. "And besides, I have heard that you told lies about me last year!" "How could I have done so?" pleaded the Lamb. "I wasn't born until this year."
<br><br/>
"If it wasn't you, it was your brother!"
<br><br/>
"I have no brothers."
<br><br>
"Well, then," snarled the Wolf, "It was someone in your family anyway. But no matter who it was, I do not intend to be talked out of my breakfast."
<br><br/>
And without more words the Wolf seized the poor Lamb and carried her off to the forest.
<br><br/>
The tyrant can always find an excuse for his tyranny.
<br><br/>
The unjust will not listen to the reasoning of the innocent.
