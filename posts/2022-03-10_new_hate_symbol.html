	<p>Once all this is over, once the mandates are removed,
	Once people are no longer forced to wear mask and have a vaccine pass. </p>

	<p>I will still feel uncomfortable 
	returning in my home country of Canada,
	surrounded by all these "Nazi" 
	who where condition and brainwashed into 
	supporting tyranny, 
	I don't feel safe around people with mask. 
	How i see them, it's like they wear a swastika on their face, 
	these people treated me, and many other, like second class citizen, 
	they violated the charter of right, they discriminated people, 
	and became hateful, fear induced bully, 
	they deluded themself in virtual echo chamber, 
	amplifying the mass induced psychos!s.
	<br>
	They fell for all cognitive bias, 
	and manipulation tactics, 
	they inverted the definition 
	of words to put the blame on the victims, and confuse 
	"lies" with "science". 
	</p>

	<p>
	I am afraid of going back, 
	afraid of being trap in this 
	asylum, for the mentally ill, that we call Canada.</p>
	</p>

	<p>They have been coerced, govern and 
	acclimatize for so long, it's no wonder
	they feel uncomfortable, without a face cover.
	<br>
	We have seen the same with the niqaab, that 
	Muslim women have to wear. Even when they escape
	their country, many feel uncomfortable without it.</p>

	<p>These mask/face cover are a symbol. 
	Many knew from the start that ALL of these measure where useless, 
	but now that the "virus" narrative is over, it is unquestionable
	that it is a symbol, the question remain, is
	it a good symbol representing freedom and peace or is
	it a symbol of hate and tyranny!</p>
