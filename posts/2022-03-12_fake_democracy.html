<p>
In a <strong>REAL</strong> Democracy citizen would be
allowed to leave their country for the same
amount of time that their "elected" ruler are
in power. In fact, in a real Democracy the 
people would not have to elect a ruler to represent them, 
people would represent them self.
people would vote directly on individual
matters. Not on idividual person (This is supposing that the "Voting" system
is not compromise, 
which it often is, if not always). 
<br><br>
A real Democracy would not force it's citizen
to be ruled by a government they do not support.
A real Democracy would let those who disagree
with the current government leave the country.
Not that i support border restriction, but that
is a other topic.
<br><br>
A real Democracy would offer at least one
alternative, is that not the goal of having
multiple candidates, to give people options?
What if some disagrees with the result of the
election? Is it normal that they are trap, in
a country ruled by a person that might make their
life miserable? No it is not.
<br><br>
This is how you create suffering, the same 
suffering that Democracy attempted to solve.
Sadly we never pushed the concept really far.
<br><br>
Every "Democracy" in history, have been fake.
They all been corruptible by design. none of 
it's exploits where patched. It was kept broken
and only made less democratic trough time.
<br><br>
A real Democracy let the people decide what is
best for them. it is direct decision making, if
you can't see how this could be achievable then
you lack imagination, we have technology that
did not even exist back when all these political
concept where invented. 
<br><br>
You may say that most people are not experts and 
that many are ignorant and highly influenceable,
and i would not argue on that, but the
alternative is not "Democracy", and it is 
surely not to have a competent professional
incorruptible, influenceable people in power.
The alternative is to risk having these same
ignorant, influenceable and corrupt member of 
our society in complete control!
<br><br> 
It is less risky to average the ignorance 
of a group. For important matter 
risk is often something that should be avoided.  
<br><br>
Imagine if when you go at 
a restaurant, instead of ordering for your self
what you want to eat, you had to pick, who would choose
for you... this is what the <strong>Fake</strong> Democracy are doing!
