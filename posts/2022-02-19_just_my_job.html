	<p>"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable" ~ John F. Kennedy</p>
	<p><strong>"I am just doing my job"</strong>, <strong>"I am just following order"</strong>
	Police, security agent, and tyrant across the country, are repeating that exact excuse.
	<strong>I was just doing my job</strong>, <strong>I was just following order</strong>
	This is what literal Nazi started saying after the fall of <strong>Nazi Germany</strong>.</p>
	<p>Some of these bully are soposedly even swearer under oath, to protect and server,
	the same people they are oppressing. If they where really "Just doing their job"
	they would stand alongside the peaceful protesters, they would server these people to the best of their ability, they would protect them, they would
	protect their fundamental rights, they would protect their constitutional rights, they would ensure
	their safety, their job is to protect the people, this is treason, they are the real criminal.</p>
	<p>"Just doing my job" is not an excuses for breaking the law and it is certainly not an excuse for
	violating the rights of the citizens!</p>
	<p>these "cops" don&rsquo;t have to do this, they are choosing money over freedom, the trucker and freedom
	supporter are risking everything for freedom, Any cop "just doing their job" are guilty
	and responsible for their actions on behalf of a defect dictator..</p>
	<p>In Canada, peacefully protest where met with violence from what appears to be "Cops",
	We have seen "Police" on horse trampling over peaceful citizen, beating them with metal stick.
	Stealing their propriety, more specifically propriety like, wood, gas, and other source of heat,
	that could help them survive the cold winter. they even return some of the gasoline half full of
	water, in the aim of breaking these people motors, those are pure evil action, committed with one
	goal, prevent a group of Canadian citizen from exerting the first amendment right to protest!</p>
	<p>Why would some people, be against forcing the population, to be injected with a product?</p>
	<p>What are anti-vax? This is a word that have been used a lot discredit peoples and arguments, just like
	calling someone a conspiracy theorist, and so on&hellip; these insult, are often unfounded, and can be use
	to divide people. It become very ironic when some of the people getting called anti-vax
	are already vaccinated. Just like it is ironic how a lot of conspiracy theory turn out
	to have been fact, with factual evidence, which eventually became undeniable even for the
	majority of the public, do these people receive excuses? should they start running around
	screaming i told you so, would that stop people from doing the same thing over and over?</p>
	<p><strong>Side note:</strong> It&rsquo;s very convenient how their is always so many crazy, unbelievable and unfounded, theory online,
	it&rsquo;s almost like some people want you to associate the word conspiracy and bullshit.
	The problem is that, when people are face with real conspiracy, one with factual evidence,
	a lot might be condition to disregard the information. It&rsquo;s almost like people
	have come to believe that "conspiracy" is a word from fiction, a concept
	which they seem to think, could not exist in reality,  a concept with no  historical precedent,
	that could never be real, sadly history know better, and hopefully people know better.</p>
	<p>Their is a difference between "supporting vaccination" (which does not apply to the "COVID vaccine"
	since it&rsquo;s not even a vaccine in the traditional use of the term) and forcing it,
	with mandates, discrimination, force and fees!
	people have the right to be skeptical of pharmaceutical company,
	their interest, and their product, they are private organization, most of them are for profit.
	if fact skepticism is on of the pillar of <strong>science!</strong> without it their can&rsquo;t be logical thinking!</p>
	<p>Their is honestly zero reasons to ever </strong>trust</strong> a large pharmaceutical company,
	Their is , however, decades of evidence of why you shouldn&rsquo;t.
	and billions of people lined up a took the shot mostly knowing anything about it.
	despite the company that produce these shot receiving the largest fines in human history!</p>
	<p>American should take note and draft lawsuits, because it is almost guarantee that the government
	will absolutely try to replicate the situation in Canada, try violating the first amendment right to
	peaceful assembly, like Trudeau is doing in Canada. if you are too complacent and think to your
	self that this will never happen in your country, think again, most the American law and constitution is
	the same then the one in Canada, and it did not suffice to prevent the current atrocity.</p>
	<p>Even when acting in the same way Nazi did, even when being warn of it, i have seen people in
	complete denial, people in position of authority, people who despite their actions being
	identical to dramatic historical event, could not even start to see the resemblance.</p>
	<p>Know your rights, otherwise you will have none.
	Know history, or you&rsquo;ll repeat it&rsquo;s mistake.</p>
