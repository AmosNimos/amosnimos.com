At first when pondering how to improve things in the world,
i thought control would help, but with further research i came to the conclusion that <strong>control</strong> was
not the right way of improving things in the world, 
after all why would anyone want that? 
I started thinking on how to improve the current system,
<strong>because</strong> i hated the current one! A system which impose excessive control over 
my life, restricting my personal freedom and liberty.
<br></br>
My personal conclusion can be resumed as follow:
Those who attempt to build a Utopia by increasing control over individuals, will inevitably
end with a dystopia. more control, more "bureaucracy" is an amateur mistake.
<br></br>
The danger of a single unified world system, is that their is no escaping it's flaws, it's
the same issue with corporate monopoly. This is why we need decentralization of our system 
to offer more alternative and thus guaranty freedom of choice.
<br></br>
Even do freedom of choice come with the risk of mistake, Taking them away is the task of the
tyrant. 
Choice is indeed a risk for mistake, but having none is a greater mistake.
<br></br>
Having multiple system, insure that there is a place where you'll be happy, 
but could be doing things wrong. 
<br></br>
Is it always a bad thing to do things "wrong", even when it work for you?
<br></br>
A lot of governments built their system on control and apply it by force,
it the unavoidable law of the strongest.  
<br></br>
For example:
<blockquote> 
Observation of an issue: More people die when being in a vehicle with no seat-belt. 
<br></br>
Solution to the issue: Forcing seat belt under a risk consequences (financial or imprisonment), which would be enforce by force.
</blockquote>
This is not a path toward freedom, and clearly not a path toward a better world.
<br></br>
If you don't let people make dumb decision, you don't let people make smart decision.
<br></br>
How about influencing/forcing people into believing "the right thing"?
This sorts of end require means that cannot be justified, and will only bring more
suffering upon our world.
<br></br>
Reversal: Should we just let human run into the wall until they find that there is a door?
<br></br>
Better being free in a world govern by idiots, then enslaved by geniuses.
<br></br>
The whole nation is in a fair way to becoming a herd of sheep, 
constantly relying on a shepherd to drive them into 
good pasture, while happily stepping into the slaughterhouse.
<br></br>
You may shatter a man bones, but only him self can shatter his will.
