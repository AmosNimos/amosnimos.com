It's crazy to me how well platform like 
YouTube, Google and Facebook can re-program/brainwash
people, I am not talking about some 
MK-Ultra type of manipulation, Just refined 
behavioral conditioning at it's finest.
<br></br>
The most important aspect of these platform,
is that most don't feel their influence,
It's a form of inception, they implant concept,
idea and even feeling in the user mind, 
without the victim ever noticing any 
external manipulation.
<br></br>
I would like to be able to simply point out to a single aspect
of this complex operation, as being the main method used,
but the truth is that it is a combination of
multiple, complex mental-bias being simultaneously exploited.
<br></br>
For example many are already aware
of the echo chamber effect, it is one of 
the method often employ by these platform
to indoctrinate people, but it is far from
being the only one.
<br></br>
However i will focus on this aspect of isolation
of opinion, since otherwise their would be too
much to write about, and this article would 
probably not be complete in my lifetime.
<br></br>
One of the advantage that modern internet based manipulation has
over the traditional more direct method, is that it can now 
be fully automated, You don't need to have a person
working full time at slowly influencing the victim,
an algorithm's can do it, with more consistent result and at a larger scale.  
<br></br>
Add to this the advancement in advance Neural Network (AI), 
and you get an adaptive cage that adapt to better mold
peoples mind into the desired shape.
<br></br>
By inducing custom made mental illness that better suit the platform needs,
this result in a society plague with mentally disordered individuals.
You can even program "Trigger" words into their subconscious preventing them
from being reason on certain topics, this makes the subject very unreasonable.
<br></br>
Good old censorship method like silencing people
voice, is a good way to keep people in a bubble of
delusion, but even this can be done in multiple 
ways. On YouTube for example you might have your comment simply vanish without a trace
as soon as you leave the page, without any warning.
On some platform undesired comment can be hidden at the bottom of the comment section, while
other that better match a certain pre-established model, will be promoted to the top.
If a platform is as daring as Facebook, it can claim to be some sort of "minister of truth", 
and use a "fact" checking system, that will hide information behind a big label of "Misinformation".
Those are only the tip of the iceberg of how opinion, views and argument,
can be hidden on the internet, this serves
to keep the subject views and ideology unchallenged.
<br></br>
Even do like I said a lot of it is automated, their is still a lot of manipulation done by manually,
You heard me right some people have well paid job patrolling the Internet wreaking
havoc trolling and promoting extremist views, this is not much different then professional
protester, who will protest or counter-protest on any cause they are paid to part take in.
It is their job to make any discussion with them pointless. They are not their to win the 
argument, but to have the last word, and use fallacious argument to discredit the opposition.
These paid troll will often try to be in charge of popular group as moderator, 
this is where they can really cause the most damage, by being in control of who are allowed to
talk on these group.
<br></br>
The strategies used by the new media, are so well-elaborated that even the countries with 
the best educational systems, succumb to the power and terror of those mafias.
"The job of media is not to inform, but to misinform: Divert public attention from important issues and changes decided by the political and economic elites, by the technique of flood or continuous flood of distractions and insignificant information." ~ Noam Chomsky
<br></br>
The solution is simple, but scary for many. 
Have your own platform!
This site of mine (amosnimos.com) is the only place, where i can be sure that my 
comments, don't get secretly deleted, this does not mean that search engine like Google, 
will not try to hide my site. It just mean that those who find it, should see it as it is,
and not trough the lens of an "evil" corporation with bad intention.
<br></br>
I found this Master's Thesis that focus on the social media TikTok, 
However I think it raise some valid concerns for all modern social media. 
People need to be aware that weaponize social media can be a real treat
to the mental integrity and autonomy of our society.

TikTok (PDF)</a>
<blockquote>
The key components of sharp power are manipulation, censorship, propaganda,
control, and influence. The result shows that China has the ability to use
TikTok in its exercise of political power, meaning that they can manipulate,
censor, propagate, control, and influence through the app if they want to.
</blockquote>
I did make a Reddit page for this blog, but after evaluating how bad these sort of
platform are, I am not sure I will keep it, 
I am still looking for a better alternative
external communication platform, 
that would allow me to receive feedback and comment 
about this blog.

quote of uncertain origin goes
