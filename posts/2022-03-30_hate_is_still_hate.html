Again about the vaccine? Yes! It is at the source of a conflict that is not over,
even do other event have happened, and the media are very eager that we all
move on to other issues, some of the social problem caused during the crisis,
are still causing harm and are still unaddressed.
<br></br>
Who will defend the unvaccinated that are victim of hate and discrimination?
Who will stand for their right?
<br></br>
The right of honest citizen who have maintained their conviction despite
the multiple unconstitutional coercion measures put in place.
<blockquote>
False narratives and fake science is commonly used to push the vaccinated populace against those who have not been vaccinated.
<br><br/>
The unvaccinated are blamed for the prevalence of Covid and accused as responsible for new cases despite no scientific justification for this. We must reject such hate promotion.
<br><br/>

</blockquote>
It is very condescending to assume that the "unvaccinated people" are more ignorant, more misinformed,
or more selfish than the vaccinated, it's a dumb over generalization of a group of diverse individual, 
it's as if people don't even recognize hate any more! 

I am sure most "unvaccinated" know more about the "vaccine" and the "science", than the vast majority of the "vaccinated" do, but that is just my personal opinion.
<br></br>
I personally sure know how vaccine <strong>used</strong> to work, and I surely know enough about the "Covid-19 shot" to
at least be skeptical of it, if not fearful. 
<blockquote>
Turning People Against People
<br><br/>
This technique has been used over and over again throughout history, with horrific results. The Nazis scapegoated the Jews, blaming them for every problem in Germany. Massive propaganda campaigns by Nazi-controlled media fueled a rising tide of hatred.
</blockquote>
The <strong>science</strong> has not change! It has been revealed! 
the "science" that the media and governments 
has fed people for the past few years, is all <strong>bullshit</strong>,
what has changed is that more and more people start to see trough the veil of lies.
<br></br>
If they told them from the start that the "science" about the shot might change,
would all the vaccinated populace have been so eager, to get injected with this experimental substance?
<br></br>
Irresponsible anti-vax rhetoric are dangerous! 
"anti-vax" have the right to question a "medical product", shaming
them from making their own judgement is equivalent to attacking skepticism.
<br></br>
Attempt at publicly shaming a group for their belief, has rarely been ethically justifiable,
in other word in most case (if not all), it is a hateful practice.
<br></br>
People get sick. We don't shame people for cancer. We don't shame people for heart disease. We shouldn't shame people for this. It's amazing what we are doing in this day and age.
<br></br>
Bashing the unvaccinated will hopefully be remembered as the primitive uncivilized movement that it is.
Nothing says more "abject failure on messaging", than forcing people to do something or try to bribe them into doing it.
<br></br>
A world where people (all people in general) are deemed too stupid to make their own choice,
think for them self, make their own decision when it
come to <strong>their</strong> own life, is an idiocracy.
