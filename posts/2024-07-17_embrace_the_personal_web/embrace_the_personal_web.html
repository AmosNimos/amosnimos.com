<p>
Many people desire an online presence, identity, and persona without dealing with the privacy-invading, manipulative nature of social media apps. If you long for the days before social media took over, there's good news: the tools and platforms that predated social media—websites, forums, blogs, and RSS feeds—are still around and experiencing a bit of a revival. This movement is often referred to as the personal web, web revival, or small web.
</p><h2>
Why Websites Over Apps?
</h2><p>
Social media apps confine your freedom of thought, expression, speech, and rights within their algorithms and corporate ideologies. A personal website, on the other hand, allows for unparalleled freedom. You can express yourself in any way you want, build your site anywhere, and host it on countless services. The possibilities are endless, offering a level of freedom and diversity that social media simply cannot match.
</p><h2>
 The Power of Blogs
</h2><p>
Blogs, often hosted on personal websites, are a powerful tool against social media censorship. They allow you to share your thoughts in long, unfiltered formats without fear of being banned or buried by algorithms. Blogs feel more genuine and real compared to the often fake and superficial content on social media. They foster a space for honest expression and critical assessment, free from the pressure of likes and followers.
</p><h2>
 The Authenticity of RSS Feeds
</h2><p>
RSS feeds offer a way to consume content without the interference of algorithms and ads. With an RSS reader, you decide what you want to see, free from the bloated content and tracking that comes with social media. This simplicity and directness make RSS a valuable tool for staying informed without the noise.
</p><h2>
 Connecting Through Web Rings
</h2><p>
One of the biggest draws of social media is connecting with others. Web rings—groups or clubs of people with their own websites—offer an alternative. These rings are especially effective when they form active communities centered around blogs or forums. However, they can become less valuable if they grow too large and lose their sense of community.
</p><h2>
 Personal Touch with Buttons
</h2><p>
Adding buttons to your website to connect with friends and fellow creators is a more personal and secure way to build a network compared to social media’s follow buttons. These buttons help combat bot accounts and foster genuine interactions.
</p><h2>
 The Benefits of Forums
</h2><p>
Forums, a staple of the personal web, provide a space for more meaningful and constructive discussions compared to the often toxic comment sections of social media. They are less prone to creating echo chambers and are better for in-depth conversations and community building.
</p><h2>
 Messaging and Chats
</h2><p>
While messaging technology still needs improvement, tools like Internet Relay Chats (IRC) offer anonymous, website-integrated communication. This aligns with the personal web's ethos of independence and privacy.
</p><h2>
 Why the Personal Web is Better
</h2><p>
Psychologically, the personal web promotes independence and reduces reliance on the manipulative algorithms of social media. It excels in freedom of expression, privacy, and security, and is less susceptible to bots and corporate control. On the personal web, you can truly be yourself, free from the constraints of corporate narratives and propaganda.
</p><h2>
 Building Your Personal Website
</h2><p>
When creating a personal website, you have two main options: a static one-page site or a more dynamic, regularly updated site. For those who prefer a set-it-and-forget-it approach, platforms like Linktree, omg.law, and Carrd are good options. For those looking to build and maintain a more complex site, learning HTML and CSS is highly recommended over using website builders, which can often complicate the process. For hosting, starting with Neocities and then moving to platforms like GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, or Codg Pages is a solid approach.
</p><h2>
 Conclusion
</h2><p>
The personal web offers a refreshing alternative to the overbearing nature of social media. It allows for true freedom of expression, privacy, and genuine connections. Whether you're looking to escape the corporate grip of social media or simply want a more authentic online presence, the personal web is a path worth exploring.
