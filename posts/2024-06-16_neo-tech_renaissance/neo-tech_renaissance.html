<h3> Modern Tech: A Double-Edged Sword</h3>

<p>
We're captivated by sleek gadgets, lured into a cycle of buying the latest and greatest. But beneath the shiny surface lurks a trade-off: convenience for control. Terms of service become shackles, binding us to ever-changing rules. Planned obsolescence forces upgrades, fueling a wasteful culture.
</p><p>
We crave complexity, but sometimes, less is more. The warmth of vinyl, the tactile feedback of an old typewriter, or the reliability of compact flash cards remind us of the beauty in simplicity.
</p><p>
It's time to challenge the status quo. We deserve transparency, control, and the right to own our devices. Let's demand ethical tech, built with independence  and sustainability in mind.
</p>

<h4> Unmasking the Truth: The Ugly Side of Modern Technology</h4>

<p>
Imagine a future where technology empowers us. A future built on informed choices and respect for privacy. Let's break free from the cycle of disposable tech and redefine progress. Are you ready to join the movement?
</p><p>
In a world seduced by the allure of shiny new gadgets, we're trapped in a cycle of consumption, chasing after the latest features and updates, only to find ourselves bound by restrictions and compromises.
</p>

<h5> The False Promise of Progress</h5>

<p>
Have you ever stopped to consider the true cost of that sleek smartphone or cutting-edge device? Beneath the surface lies a sinister truth: we're trading our autonomy for the illusion of innovation, blindly agreeing to terms that surrender our rights to control what we've purchased.
</p>

<h5>Ownership vs. Servitude: A Digital Dilemma</h5>

<p>
We must reject the notion of a future where we must seek permission to uninstall an app from a device we supposedly own. Instead, we should support and use technology that not only meets our needs but also aligns with our principles of ideology, philosophy, and personal freedom. Most terms of service are like shackles, binding us to agreements that can change with the next software update—leaving us little choice but to comply or render our devices useless.
</p>
<h5> The Rise of Disposable Tech and Planned Obsolescence</h5>

<p>
We've normalized a culture where gadgets are designed to break down, pushing us to buy the next upgrade sooner rather than later. It's a vicious cycle of consumerism driven by profit margins, not durability or sustainability. What happened to the craftsmanship of old, where products were built to last?
</p>

<h5> Rediscovering the Beauty in Simplicity</h5>

<p>
Sometimes, less is more. Remember the joy of using a film camera, the satisfaction of crafting a basic HTML website, or the reliability of compact flash cards? These examples remind us that sometimes the old ways can offer a richer, more engaging experience.
</p>

<h5> Awakening to a New Digital Consciousness</h5>

<p>
It's time to wake up and challenge the status quo. We must demand transparency, accountability, and above all, the right to truly own the tools we purchase. Imagine a world where technology serves humanity, not the other way around. Where innovation is driven by values of inclusivity and sustainability. It starts with us—making informed choices, supporting products and platforms that respect our autonomy and privacy.
</p>

<h5> Reevaluating Old vs. New</h5>

<p>
Why do we often discard what works? Take CRT screens, for instance. They may be bulkier, but they offer perfectly smooth grayscale with an infinite number of intensity levels, fast response times, and no motion artifacts. Despite these advantages, where are all the CRT gamers? I like CRTs for Pico-8 games, indie pixel art games, and retro gaming.
</p>

<h5> The Rise of Neo-Tech</h5>

<p>
Imagine a world where old technologies evolve alongside modern advancements. This "neo-tech" concept revitalizes proven ideas with today's innovations, emphasizing durability and repairability over disposable gadgets designed with planned obsolescence.
</p>

<h5> The Old Web: A Digital Frontier Lost</h5>

<p>
The internet of yesteryears was a decentralized, creative realm. Websites, crafted with HTML and CSS by passionate individuals, were unique expressions rather than uniform templates optimized for profit. Today, social media giants dominate, relegating users to rented digital spaces devoid of autonomy.
</p>

<h5> Crafting a Modern Renaissance</h5>

<p>
Some advocate for a return to basics—a web where personal blogs reclaim prominence. Free from cookies and trackers, these spaces prioritize transparency and user control. Imagine a website devoid of intrusive pop-ups, where every script and image serves a purpose explained to the visitor.
</p>
<h5> A Call for Authenticity</h5>
<p>
The allure lies not in merely replicating the past but in distilling its essence: reliability, creativity, and user empowerment. As technology hurtles forward, perhaps there's wisdom in revisiting what worked—both for its functionality and its intangible qualities that modernity often overlooks.
</p><p>
In conclusion, while not all old tech deserves a resurrection, dismissing the past entirely risks losing valuable lessons. As we navigate the future, let's embrace a thoughtful blend of old and new—a neo-tech movement that honors craftsmanship, sustainability, and the enduring appeal of authenticity.
