One of the great contribution of the matrix movie to our modern
culture is the symbolism of the "Pills" a metaphor representing 
the choice between: 
<br></br>
Red Pill: A life of harsh knowledge, 
desperate freedom, and the brutal truths of reality. 
<br></br>
Blue Pill: A life of luxurious security, tranquil happiness, and the blissful ignorance of illusion.The symbolism of the Pills from "the matrix" movie is a very powerful
image that brought many great philosophical views and ideology.
<br></br>
'Red pill' has become a popular phrase among cyber-culture and signifies a free-thinking attitude, and a waking up from a "normal" life of sloth and ignorance. Red pills prefer the truth, no matter how gritty and painful it may be.
<br></br>
A more recent therm used online is the "Black Pill" which for refer 
to a more nihilistic version of the "Red Pill", but I personally see it
as the more concentrated version of the "Blue Pill" a form of 
acceptance of the illusion despite knowing the truth. 
<br></br>
Black Pill: Nothing matters and there is nothing you can do that will change anything, it depraves you of all positive thought. 
<br></br>
Sadly this "Black Pill" idiotic way of thinking is not uncommon in our modern society.
It is a self fulfilling prophecy, the more people share this way of thinking, the more it becomes true. 
Even if it was true, it would still be, an unhealthy counter productive ideology.
<br></br>
This remind me of the 4 stage strategy  
<br></br>
"Stage 1: We say nothing is going to happen.
Stage 2: We say something may be about to happen, but we should do nothing about it.
Stage 3: We say maybe we should do something about it, but there's nothing we can do.
Stage 4: We say maybe there was something, but it's too late now." - Humphrey Appleby from the British television series Yes Minister
<br></br>
When I post article about the treat that we are currently facing,
the last thing I want is for people to fall for this lazy Black Pill
mentality. It's exactly by thinking like this that we lose.
The main thing you can do is share the "Red Pill", by sharing awareness.
<br></br>
Often the solution are simpler than we think, but the deeper we sink
in the modern illusion/delusion, the more individual autonomy we sacrifice, the more
dependent of the system we become, the
harder it is to visualize an escape.
