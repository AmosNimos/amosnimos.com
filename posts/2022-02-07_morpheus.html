	Let me tell you why you're here.
	You're here because you know something, what you know, you can't explain.
	But you feel it. You've probably felt it your entire life.
	</p>
	<p>
	That there's something _wrong_ with the world.
	You don't know what it is, but it's there...like a splinter
	in you're mind, driving you mad. It is probably this feeling that has
	brought you here. Do you <strong>know</strong> what I'm talking about?
	Do you <strong>want</strong> to know.... what <strong>it</strong> is....?
	</p>
	<p>
	The <strong>Media</strong> Matrix is everywhere. It's all around us, even in this
	very moment. You can see it when you open window or
	when you turn on your television.
	You can feel when you search google, or post on Facebook.
	The Media Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes,
	to blind you from the truth...
	</p>
	<p>
	That you are a slave. Like everyone else, you were born
	into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell,
	taste or touch. A prison...for your mind! Unfortunately,
	no one can be... <strong>told</strong> what the truth is... you have to see
	it for yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
	Remember... all I'm offering you is the truth
	nothing more, nothing less.
