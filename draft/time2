    <h1>The Illusion of Freedom in Capitalism</h1>

    <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> <em>The Illusion of Freedom in Capitalism</em> is a thought-provoking exploration of the constraints and paradoxes within our capitalist society. Through personal reflections and critical analysis, I delve into the nature of true freedom, the economic pressures we face, and the existential dilemmas that accompany our pursuit of autonomy. This article challenges the reader to rethink the conventional wisdom about work, retirement, and self-sufficiency.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction: The Illusion of Freedom</h2>
    <p>If one has to work to live, one isn't free. By <em>live</em>, I do not merely imply survive but to thrive.</p>
    
    <p>We trade time for money, but money cannot buy time. In a capitalistic society, one cannot truly live without money. This means we have to trade some of our life to get to live. This raises the question: how much of our life do we need to spend to buy our freedom?</p>
    
    <p>Sadly, in our current society, there is no fixed answer, and some may never be able to afford their freedom.</p>
    
    <p>In my country of Canada and many others, retirement is merely a carrot on a stick, but that carrot can only be reached once it has rotted away.</p>

    <h2 id="time-money">2. The Time-Money Paradox</h2>
    <p>The ideal is to retire when we are young, to have the energy and health to truly enjoy life to the fullest. But that ideal isn't realistic. If we all stopped working when we were young and healthy, who would fill these roles? Then we would need to work when old and sick, and that's not ideal. For our current capitalistic society to work, we need to at least spend some of our life working. If not when we are young, it would need to be when we are old. If not, when? When is our time not valuable to us? When are we able to work and willing to sell our time for money?</p>
    
    <p>Some might say never. Some might even say we need to learn to love the work we do, but not all jobs are lovable. Yet we need people to do them; that's why ungrateful jobs often pay more.</p>

    <h2 id="retirement">3. The Mirage of Retirement</h2>
    <p>Here, I critique the conventional idea of retirement, arguing that it often remains out of reach for many and comes too late to be truly enjoyed.</p>

    <h2 id="costs-survival">4. Economic Shackles: Living Costs and Survival</h2>
    <p>Most people work all their lives and never get to be free. Statistically, you are most people. You were born a slave and will die a slave. Autonomy is the key. Minimize expenses and be more self-sufficient. Invest wisely in things that make you more independent.</p>
    
    <p>Minimize expenditure; if needed, have five roommates. Rent is probably the most expensive necessity, followed by phone and internet access. Food is hard to be self-sufficient at, nearly impossible in the urban landscape. Land is freedom. Get good land, start to grow things, and make things. Be an artisanâ€”create, trade, sell.</p>
    
    <p>Create a community. This is key. The community is power.</p>

    <p>A cohesive group that acts together and helps each other can achieve what the individual can't.</p>

    <p>This might be the only way to earn our freedom for most of us, to work as a community and not alone.</p>

    <h2 id="existential-reflections">5. Existential Reflections and Life Planning</h2>
    <p>To help myself plan ahead, I made a program that estimates my life expectancy. This makes me feel like I have an existential crisis once in a while, to be able to open a loading bar that leads to my inevitable demise. Here is the gist of it.</p>
    
    <p>I, a 28-year-old man, with an average life and health, can estimate based on statistical averages that I can probably live another 540 months, that's the total, meaning around 400 young and healthy months. Hypothetically speaking, being at about 37% of my life, in the best case, another 45 years is what I should expect. This is probably not far from the truth unless some unfortunate event ends my journey sooner.</p>
    
    <p>Knowing this, I need to plan what to do with the remaining 63% of my life. How much does it cost to be fully self-sufficient? To be off the grid? Not dependent on the system, to be free to spend my time as I wish? All without wasting the majority of my younger years, because at some point life only goes downhill.</p>
    
    <p>Assuming I start from nothing and can't get more than minimum wage, is it even possible to truly achieve what I consider to be freedom in my lifetime? Can I get a home? A constant food source? Maybe some passive income?</p>

    <h2 id="nihilistic-perspective">6. A Nihilistic Perspective</h2>
    <p>The sooner, the better. The sad thing about humanity is the need to leave our marks, knowing that none of it truly matters when we are gone. In the end, nihilism is right: all is dust, and all will go back to dust.</p>
    
    <p>One personal aspect I would like to touch on is the insecurity that my parents, who for a long time have played a crucial part in my life, are not immortal and will one day leave me. When I think about the shortness of my lifespan, it only makes me realize how short of a time I have to spend with them. I wish I could have more freedom and resources to take better care of them; they deserve it. I care for them very much, and the very idea of having to live on without one of them is truly unpleasant.</p>

    <h2 id="financial-planning">7. The Sobering Reality of Financial Planning</h2>
    <p>At almost 28 years old (in one month), it's almost too late to acquire true freedom. Even in the best-case scenario, following all the steps for financial independence and a healthy life, all I can realistically hope for is 15 years of freedom. This isn't meant to paint a fully nihilistic picture, but it's the rational conclusion I've come to.</p>
    
    <p>Saving a little money in the next two years to at least study something that could lead to a better-paying job seems like a logical step. However, with the current rate of inflation and the struggling economy, is that truly enough? Bank savings accounts with interest rates typically around 0.01% are not going to allow for any sufficient freedom.</p>
    
    <p>This would give me an additional 15 years to enjoy my freedom if everything goes to plan and not too many unforeseen events occur. At almost 28 years old, it's almost too late to acquire freedom in the best case. All I can get is 15 years of freedom following all the steps for financial independence and a healthy life. This is not to paint a fully nihilistic picture but this is the current rationale I came to. I do think that saving a little money in the next 2 years to at least be able to study in something I could then have a better-paying job but at the current rate of inflation and how bad the economy is doing it, is that truly enough? Bank savings account interest (usually 0.01%) is not going to allow for any sufficient freedom.</p>
