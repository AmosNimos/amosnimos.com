Title: "The Illusion of Cheap Websites: The Dark Truth Behind DIY Site Builders"

In today's digital age, it's never been easier to build a website. With the rise of "IDE" website builders like WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace, anyone can create a website with just a few clicks. But what is the true cost of taking the easy route?

Unfortunately, these DIY website builders come with limitations and potential security risks that are often overlooked. While they may seem like a cheap and quick solution, in the long run, they end up costing more than they're worth. And it's not just WordPress that's guilty of this; all of these online website builders have the same issues.

The sad truth is that the era of the web-developer seems to be over. The vast majority of people only need basic websites and are willing to settle for the limitations of these online builders. But the reality is that these builders can end up costing more than hiring a professional web-developer to code a website from scratch.

So, while these online builders may seem like a cheap and easy solution, the reality is that they're just an illusion. The true cost of building a website goes beyond the upfront cost and includes security risks, limitations, and potential long-term costs. Don't fall for the illusion of cheap websites; invest in a professional web-developer and build a website that's truly secure and functional.
