It's frustrating when people criticize without fully understanding the effort behind a project. Many seem to assume that using AI is a one-click solution, completely overlooking the work that still goes into making something functional, let alone useful. Let me clarify a few things for those quick to dismiss my work just because I used AI tools like ChatGPT.

First off, to the naysayers: I've been coding for years, long before ChatGPT became a thing. My skills and experience are not up for debate. AI is just another tool in my toolbox, much like a search engine or an IDE (which I don't use btw). If you think using AI makes a project less valuable, then you're stuck in a narrow mindset. The real value of any project lies in the end result and how well it meets its goals, not in whether every line of code was typed by hand.

Now, some of you criticized my web browser project as if I was trying to pass off AI-generated code as my own with zero effort. That's just not true. I didn't just copy-paste code from ChatGPT and call it a day. I used AI to assist with certain tasks, like finding libraries or helping me structure parts of the project. But I also spent countless hours debugging, refining, and improving the code. AI didn't build the projectâ€”I did, with AI as a helpful assistant.

To those who say this is just a "toy demo" or "not a real web browser," I ask: what have you built lately? It's easy to criticize when you're not the one putting in the work. My project is a starting point, an exploration of what's possible with minimal tools. Sure, it's not going to compete with Chrome or Firefox, but that was never the goal. It's about experimenting, learning, and creating something new. If you can't see the value in that, then maybe you're not as passionate about programming as you think.

And let's be real: the "AI bad" mentality is just as shortsighted as any other tech panic. Whether it's AI, search engines, or even just coding frameworks, tools are there to help us create. If you're so worried about AI taking over, maybe it's because you don't trust your own skills enough to adapt and keep up.

Lastly, for those who are genuinely interested in my project, I appreciate the support. Not every project is going to be groundbreaking, but every project is a step forward, a learning experience. If you're here to learn, to experiment, or to support others doing the same, then you're in the right place. If you're just here to hate, maybe consider what that says about your own work.

In conclusion, I don't regret using AI to help with my projects. I'll keep creating, keep learning, and keep using whatever tools are available to make the best work I can. If you can't respect that, then your criticism means little to me.
