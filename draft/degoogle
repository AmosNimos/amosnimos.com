In an era where tech giants hold dominion over our digital lives, breaking free from their grasp and reclaiming control over our devices has become a growing movement. I embarked on this journey myself, hoping to liberate my Google Pixel 8 from the clutches of big-tech dominance by installing Calyx OS. However, my experience with this de-Googled operating system left much to be desired.

Calyx OS promised a sanctuary away from the prying eyes of data-hungry corporations, but in reality, it felt like a mere facsimile of my previous operating system. The transition was seamless, but the familiarity of the apps I used remained unchanged. Worse still, compatibility issues plagued certain applications, undermining the very purpose of my departure from the mainstream.

Summary: Transitioning to Calyx OS promised liberation from big-tech dominance, yet the experience fell short due to familiar app reliance and compatibility issues, challenging the essence of tech independence.

But every setback presents an opportunity for exploration, and I delved into the realm of alternative operating systems. PureOS and GrapheneOS emerged as frontrunners, offering enhanced security features such as sandboxing apps. Yet, the pursuit of true tech independence remains elusive, with financial constraints delaying my acquisition of a PinePhone—a beacon of hope in the de-Googled landscape.

One of the most glaring disparities I encountered was in navigation. The default maps app provided by Calyx OS paled in comparison to the omnipotent Google Maps. In its stead, I turned to Waze, a worthy substitute that navigates me through the labyrinthine streets of modernity without succumbing to the all-seeing eye of big tech.

Summary: Exploring alternative OS options like PureOS and GrapheneOS revealed enhanced security features, yet financial limitations delay acquiring a PinePhone, while navigation shortcomings in Calyx OS led to reliance on Waze for seamless navigation, highlighting a key challenge in the de-Googled journey.

The struggle for a seamless YouTube experience epitomized the challenges of living in a de-Googled world. With the native app faltering, I devised a workaround—a clever shortcut that redirects me to a Chromium page, allowing me to enjoy content with the screen closed while wielding the power of ad-blocking extensions and resurrecting the long-lost dislike button.

Communication, too, posed its own set of hurdles. Element emerged as my lifeline, facilitating connections with friends and family while circumventing the data-siphoning behemoths of social media. Instagram, Facebook, and their ilk became relics of a bygone era, incompatible with the ethos of my de-Googled existence.

Summary: Navigating YouTube challenges in a de-Googled environment led to a creative workaround, while reliance on Element for communication underscored the incompatibility of mainstream social media with the ethos of tech independence.

In the grand scheme of things, my journey thus far has been met with a resounding "meh." Termux offers a glimpse into the realm of rooted freedom, but its limitations serve as a stark reminder of the compromises inherent in the pursuit of tech independence.

As I continue to navigate the tumultuous seas of the de-Googled world, one thing remains clear: the path to true tech independence is fraught with challenges, but the rewards—a sense of autonomy and liberation—are well worth the journey. So, let us forge ahead, armed with the knowledge that even in a world where every aspect of our devices is locked down, there exists a glimmer of hope for those daring enough to defy the status quo.

Conclusion: Despite encountering setbacks, my journey towards tech independence has been met with mixed feelings. While Termux offers a glimpse of rooted freedom, its limitations remind me of the compromises inherent in this pursuit. Yet, amidst challenges, the pursuit of autonomy and liberation in the de-Googled world remains worthwhile, offering hope for those daring enough to challenge the status quo.

P.S. Imagine a world where advanced technology coexists with simplicity and transparency, where accessing and customizing system components to fit our needs is effortless. In this ecosystem, alternatives to corporate monopolies thrive, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment where hobbyists and enthusiasts contribute to the evolution of software. It's a vision where innovation is fueled by passion and cooperation, paving the way for a more inclusive and diverse tech landscape. Let's work towards making this vision a reality, where empowerment and choice reign supreme in the digital realm.
