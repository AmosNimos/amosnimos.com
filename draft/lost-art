## Urban Self-Resilience: A Practical Guide for City survivalism 

Welcome to my urban Survival Secrets, a series of blog articles dedicated to practical knowledge for the urban survivalist. 

This series focuses on city preppersâ€”people who adapt to modern society using wisdom from older generations to improve their lives and gain more autonomy. Our goal is to provide technical, short, and clear information that has been tested and perfected, especially for those on a tight budget who need to survive in our modern world.

From DIY projects to fermenting foods, growing sprouts, and making alcoholic beverages, this series covers it all. Learn how to save money and make the initial ingredients you need to do even more. Once you master germination, you can use sprouts for fermented foods. Once you know how to make vinegar, you can use it to preserve food. Learn packaging techniques to save food for later, and much more.

Our articles will provide practical knowledge for your essential needs, helping you not only survive but thrive. Each article will include links to downloadable files, such as PDFs and HTML formats, for easy access and practical carry.

Join us in this journey to urban self-reliance and discover the lost arts of city survival!
