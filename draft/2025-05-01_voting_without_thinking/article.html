When Fools Decide the Future
it isn’t democracy. It’s idiocracy with better branding.
</p><p>
We let the uninformed vote. 
</p><p>
People who can’t name a policy. 
</p><p>
Who confuse fiction with fact. 
</p><p>
Who vote on feelings, not reason. 
</p><p>
This is how civilizations collapse.
</p><p>
If you can’t pass a basic quiz on what each party stands for, 
</p><p>
what their candidates have done, and what they promise to do 
</p><p>
what are you voting for? Vibes? Memes? Rage?
</p><p>
An ignorant with a vote is more dangerous than a tyrant. 
</p><p>
At least a tyrant knows what they’re doing.
</p><p>
We test for licenses to drive, to practice medicine, to cut hair. 
</p><p>
But not to vote? Not to decide the fate of nations?
</p><p>
If your choices are shaped by propaganda, if you can’t separate truth from fiction, you are not qualified to vote.
</p><p>
There is no Democracy without wisdom.
</p><p>
We don’t need more voices. We need better ones.
</p><p>
When the informed vote, it's an democracy.
When the ignorant vote, it's an idiocracy.
</p><p>
Let me ask you this — should the delusional, the irrational, the ignorant, the mentally unfit, and the brainwashed be allowed to steer a nation simply because there are enough of them?
