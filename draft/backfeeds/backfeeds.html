    <h1>Backfeeds and Webmention</h1>
    <h2>What are Backfeeds?</h2>
    <p>Backfeeds are a way to aggregate interactions from different social media platforms back to the original content on an independent website. For example, if someone likes or comments on a post you shared on Twitter, backfeeds will pull that interaction back to your personal site where the original post resides. This helps to centralize engagement, giving you a complete view of how your content is being interacted with across various platforms.</p>

    <h2>What is Webmention?</h2>
    <p>Webmention is a protocol that enables websites to notify each other when content is mentioned or linked. It allows one website to automatically inform another when a link is created to its content. For instance, if someone writes a blog post and links to your article, Webmention sends a notification to your site, which can then display the link as a comment or mention. This creates a decentralized way of interacting and connecting content across different sites.</p>

    <h2>How They Work Together</h2>
    <p>When combined, backfeeds and Webmention provide a robust system for managing and displaying interactions on independent websites. Backfeeds gather engagement data from various social platforms, while Webmention ensures you are aware of mentions and links from other websites. This integration promotes a more connected and interactive web, where content and conversations are not confined to a single platform but are spread across the open internet.</p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>Using backfeeds and Webmention has several advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Decentralization: They support the decentralized web by allowing content to interact across different platforms and sites.</li>
        <li>Ownership: You maintain control over your content and its interactions, as they are aggregated back to your personal site.</li>
        <li>Engagement: They provide a complete view of how your content is being engaged with, regardless of where the interaction takes place.</li>
    </ul>
