have you heard of groups like "the Cult of the Dead Cow"
once their was hackers space, what are hackerspeace and what is the take 
way? group of anarchist trying to take over the world? NO!
A group of creative minded people working together on diy projects?
YES! and F&ck YES!
we need more of these place to learn skills and have access to tools
to make the actual good part of the comunist dream ideology a reality.

which is if the people have the tools and knowladge they can be indepenedent
and I think that an independent nation is a freenation.

we need to develope more diy skills, 
make stuff small scale, make our own food, make our own trading systems
because the global economy is rigged, but we don't need their paper to
trade services between our self, to lend our tools and craftmenship.
we can all contribute and we can all gain independency by wroking together
and my sharing what we know.
