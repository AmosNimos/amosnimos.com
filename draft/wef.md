"You will own nothing and be happy," was never about a utopian dream for the average person.

It was a vision crafted by elites who assume control over everything while the rest are left dependent, stripped of ownership, and without true autonomy.

They just think most people are too dumb to realise what it means.

It’s not about liberation; it’s about control. The idea that people would be happier renting everything, living in subscription-based economies, and relying on centralized systems is a utopia for the rich and a nightmare for the poor. When you own nothing, you control nothing. The fewer assets you have, the more dependent you are on the system.

This isn’t some baseless conspiracy, it’s the logical outcome of policies that favor corporate and government monopolization over personal independence. Land, homes, vehicles, and even digital goods are being shifted from personal ownership to "services" that can be revoked or controlled at any time.

Forcing a subscription to use hardware you already bought is straight-up anti-consumer robbery. 

Having a product stop working unless you pay them continuously, ain’t just unethical, it’s likely illegal under consumer protection laws.

A product you own shouldn’t require a forced service to function. That’s like buying a car and being told you can’t drive unless you pay a monthly fee to the manufacturer. Total scam.

The law should step in, but big corporations love pushing the limits until they get slapped with lawsuits. If regulators don’t act, folks should just boycott companies that pull this nonsense.
