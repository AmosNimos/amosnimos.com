### Title: Godot's Downfall: Can the Forks Survive, or Is It Already Too Late?

The ongoing wave of political purges in open source projects has claimed yet another victim: the Godot game engine. Once celebrated for its open-source ethos, it has now plunged into controversy, banning users and developers alike for daring to suggest that Godot should focus on software, not politics. This mass banning spree, which hit various platforms like GitHub and Discord, was carried out by a clique of Godot moderators who seem more invested in promoting a social agenda than fostering a developer community. The result? Many users have decided that Godot is dead. But does the future lie in these forks? And can they actually survive without the political baggage that has infected the original project?

#### What Happened to Godot?

Recently, Godot’s official accounts posted a tweet about the engine going "woke," inviting developers to showcase their "Wokot games." In no time, the backlash started to roll in, with users calling for the game engine to stay neutral and focused on software development. Instead of addressing concerns, moderators launched into a tirade, banning dissenters, financial supporters, and developers alike.

One moderator, "Nat," who self-identifies as "Obnoxiously Queer," seemed to spearhead this purge. Another, named "xananax," unleashed vulgar rants, calling those who disagreed "toxic vomit" and "the filth of humanity," further escalating the situation. Godot's management response to the controversy has been vague and unsatisfactory, providing only a brief statement that bans would not be lifted. The result is a fracture in the community.

#### Forking the Code: A Good Idea, But Not Enough

In response to this, numerous Godot users have started forking the project, with the most popular being Redot. The idea here is simple: keep the code, ditch the politics. But there’s a hard reality many of these users don’t seem to acknowledge—forking an open-source project and maintaining it requires much more than just cloning a repository.

It's not impossible to take Godot’s codebase and create something new from it, but few developers have the skills necessary to understand and build upon the source code to the extent required. Game engines are complex systems, and keeping them bug-free and up-to-date takes significant expertise. Many people are jumping on the Redot train, but without a deep understanding of the code, Redot and similar projects may face inevitable abandonment. Forking isn't just about copy-pasting code; it’s about maintaining a project’s future viability.

#### The History of Open Source Fork Failures

This isn’t the first time a prominent open-source project has faced mass forking. When Audacity started integrating spyware into its software, developers tried to fork it into various projects like Tenacity, but none gained traction. Forks often lose steam because people stick with what they know—users get attached to names and brands. The fact is, Godot’s reputation has been severely tarnished, but will people even remember these forks in a few years? Forks rarely rise to the popularity of the originals because maintaining and evolving a project is hard work, and if these forks lack proper leadership, they'll likely fade away.

#### Why Open Source is at Risk

The death of Godot is emblematic of a broader issue within the open-source world: politics are getting in the way of good code. From NixOS to openSUSE, the Linux world is no stranger to ideological purges. When developers and users are more concerned with enforcing political orthodoxy than writing solid software, it creates a toxic environment where innovation dies, and projects collapse. Godot isn’t the first, and it won’t be the last. 

Take, for example, the Ladybird Project. Their Code of Conduct explicitly states that "Participants will be tolerant of opposing views" and "should always assume good intentions." This is how a healthy open-source community should operate—debates should be about the code, not personal attacks or purges based on political ideology. Projects that embrace tolerance will survive, while those that engage in divisive politics will die. 

#### Conclusion: Is Godot Really Dead?

It’s too early to definitively say whether Godot is truly dead or if one of these forks will rise to take its place. Right now, the forks like Redot offer hope for those who want a neutral, apolitical game engine. But forking is only the first step. To succeed, these projects need people with the technical knowledge to keep the engine running and improving, not just a crowd of developers running from a burning ship.

Ultimately, the situation surrounding Godot is a cautionary tale for the open-source world. When software stops being about the software, when it becomes a battleground for ideological wars, everyone loses. Godot went woke, and as the saying goes, "Go woke, go broke." Only time will tell if its forks can break free of its shadow or whether they too will be dragged down by the weight of Godot’s fall.

The lesson here is simple: **good code has no politics.** If these new forks want to succeed, they’ll need to remember that.
