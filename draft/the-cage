Personally, I don't use .NET, and my original point focused on typical computer usage. RAM needs vary by task and software. .NET isn't essential, but some prefer it. While I manage just fine on 4GB RAM running multiple apps simultaneously across workspaces, minimal Linux distros on a full tty can achieve very low usage, potentially as low as 100-200MB. TempleOS takes it a step further, running on as low as 512MB of RAM â€“ all without .NET, as its creator intended.
Some users, like well-trained birds, find comfort in the security of a familiar cage. They know exactly where the seeds are and the bars offer a sense of protection.
