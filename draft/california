California legalised crime, and crime insued.
When they pass law like this, heck any laws,
Their should be a quick system in place to revert back 
in case it goes horribly wrong, 
this was a test. the test failed now what? 
If less legal punishment made things worse? 
How about more? the main issue is that the punishment 
when in form of fines are not proportional to one earnings, 
so for rich people these fines means nothing. so first the system should be proportional to how much one earns.
