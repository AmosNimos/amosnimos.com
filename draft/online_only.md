### **Canada’s Online-Only Madness: Why Are We Forced to Do Everything on the Internet?**  

What in the **actual hell** is going on in Canada? You need a job, so you put on decent clothes, walk into a business, and politely ask to submit your resume. What do they say? **"Apply online."** You want to sign up for a gym, **in person**, at the front desk, where the staff is literally paid to handle memberships. What do they say? **"Go fill out the form online."**  

Are we serious? Are we actually saying **you must have** a smartphone, a computer, and internet access to do the most basic things? This isn’t just inconvenient, it’s a **trap**. Not everyone has unlimited data, a working laptop, or time to fight with some broken, convoluted online form that probably doesn’t even load properly.  

And let’s talk about jobs for a second. If you’re hiring people who **won’t even bother coming in person to apply**, what makes you think they’ll bother **showing up to work on time**? The absolute **bare minimum** for a job is showing up, and we’re removing that from the process entirely. **Who benefits from this?**  

This isn’t about **convenience**, it’s about **forcing people** into a digital system that not everyone wants or can access. It’s a lazy excuse to **replace human interaction with a broken, frustrating, impersonal process**. If I’m standing in front of you, **ready to sign up, pay, or hand you my resume**, there is absolutely **zero reason** to send me home to fight with a glitchy website.  

This online-only nonsense is **idiocracy in action**. We need to push back, because this isn’t just about technology, it’s about **basic accessibility and common sense**. If a human can help, **let them help**. Stop treating everything like it has to be done through a damn screen.
