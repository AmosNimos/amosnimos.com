Autonomy is freedom from domination.

Those who fail to rely on themselves will forever be bound to those they rely on. 

Be self-reliant, for those who depend on others will always be at their mercy.

Be self-sufficient, master yourself, and you need no master. 

Depend on none, and none will control you.

To depend on others is to surrender control; only the independents are truly free.

# The free Tech users ideology:

1. **Avoid tools from companies you deem unethical or evil.** You shouldn’t feel obligated to use products that conflict with your values.
   
2. **Prioritize transparency and understanding.** Only use tech you can fully grasp and control—avoid tools that lock you out of knowing how they work.

3. **Reject unnecessary complexity and bloat.** Stick to simple solutions. If something can be done with fewer dependencies, make it so.

4. **Embrace self-reliance in tech.** Build your own tools when possible and avoid relying on corporate, proprietary systems that can change or become obsolete.

5. **If it can be done in the terminal, do it in the terminal.** The terminal represents control, efficiency, and mastery.

6. **Reject the cloud.** At its core, it’s just renting someone else's computer. Own and control your infrastructure.

7. **APIs shouldn’t gate public data.** If something is freely accessible in a browser, you shouldn't need special permissions to access it via terminal.

8. **Stay offline where possible.** Avoid tools that require an internet connection to function when local alternatives exist.
