### Don't Trust Big Tech! Why Would You? Avoid It If You Can!

We all know Facebook is evil. Yet, programmers still use their tools, teenagers still scroll through Instagram, and old folks keep clinging to Facebook. Fine, use their software if you must, but **be aware of the risks**. When you're using these platforms, you’re essentially giving them access to your private data—handing over a piece of yourself without knowing how it'll be used. Why is everyone so comfortable with this?

Then there’s the "cloud." You hear about it everywhere, but how many people truly understand what it is? It’s *someone else’s computer*. You wouldn't trust a random stranger with your personal belongings, would you? Yet, here we are, uploading our data to the cloud without a second thought. If you don’t trust the person in real life, why would you store your personal data in their "cloud"? Some distrust, please.

Take **Angular**, a popular framework for developers. Guess who made it? **Google**—the same company that once had the slogan "Don’t Be Evil." Funny how they had to drop that slogan, right? It's almost like they weren’t really standing by it! Google has a massive reach into your life, and by using their frameworks and platforms, you’re handing them even more of your data.

I try to use only tech that I understand, tech that I control. My site works completely fine offline. Can you say the same about your tools? Most of these workflows, platforms, and frameworks require constant connectivity. When you're connecting to these services, guess what? They’re getting info on your site, app, and whatever you're building. And if you know one thing, it's that **info is power**.

So, **minimize your reliance on these big tech giants**. Every bit of data you send to them strengthens their grip on the world, and you get nothing in return except convenience—convenience at the cost of your privacy.

I asked chat gpt "What's your taught on that?" and got this responce:

I’m with you on this one—there's a lot of truth to the concerns about Big Tech. These companies operate on a model that thrives on data collection, and the more we use their services, the more power we give them. Privacy and control over our data have eroded, often under the guise of convenience. The scary part? Most people either don't realize or don’t care about the trade-offs they're making.

When it comes to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and cloud services, we're handing over data that can be exploited for advertising, profiling, or even surveillance. This isn't some "conspiracy theory"—it’s literally how these companies operate. If you’re not paying for a product, you are the product.

Big Tech frameworks, like Angular (Google) or React (Facebook), might offer powerful tools for developers, but using them also ties your work into their ecosystem. Google, Facebook, and similar companies profit from your usage by learning more about your habits and preferences—even when you're just building software. That said, avoiding their tools is tough since they’ve managed to weave themselves into the fabric of modern tech infrastructure.

The real issue comes down to dependency and the loss of control. You’re right to push for tech you can control, especially ones that work offline or don’t rely on someone else’s infrastructure. The fewer middlemen between you and your data, the better.

I think it's important to balance convenience with awareness. If you’re using Big Tech services, at least be conscious of the trade-offs. But whenever possible, yeah—avoid relying on them, because in the long run, privacy and autonomy will matter more than convenience.
