## Blog Post: Projects, Privacy, and CLI Power  

Hey there, it's **amosnimos** back at it with too many projects and not enough time. Currently, my mind is buzzing with ideas, some in progress and others waiting in the pipeline. Thought I’d share an update on what’s cooking. Let's dive right into it.  

### CLI Pokémon-Inspired Game  
I’ve been working on this fully CLI-based Pokémon-like game for Linux. No fancy visuals—just the raw charm of ASCII art and the terminal. The goal is to keep everything lean, fast, and without dependencies on big, bloated libraries or engines. Simplicity and power. If you can do it in the terminal, then *why not?*  

### Graphical Version of CoinChase  
I’m also cooking up a graphical version of **CoinChase**, taking it beyond its basic mechanics. No IDEs or game engines here—just raw code, hand-rolled like a proper programmer’s game. Building this purely from scratch without the safety net of Unity or Godot because, well, they’re distractions. What’s a game if it’s not written in a text editor and born in the command line, right?  

### Eretic Distro of TempleOS  
When I get a chance, I want to dive into **TempleOS**—or at least my version of it. I’m thinking about turning it into an *eretical* distro that goes against the grain. There’s something deeply appealing about Terry’s vision for the OS, even if it’s chaotic genius. Strip out the fluff, make it bash-compatible, and maybe it’ll become the OS of the future (or a fun side project if nothing else). Might even shoot a **YouTube** video about it if time permits—stay tuned for that.  

### Fixing and Refining Utilities  
I’m also doing some housekeeping on a couple of my CLI tools:  
- **Flag Parsing with Print_Help Generator**: This needs to work smoother. When a script offers options, it better explain them without me having to write 50 lines of documentation by hand. Automation is the way.  
- **SFX CLI Program**: I’ve been meaning to get back to this. Making sound effects straight from the terminal would be next-level. Just imagine, no Audacity, no DAWs—just commands spitting out sound waves.  
- **CLI 3D Object Editor**: Yes, I said 3D in the terminal. It might sound wild, but that’s exactly why I need to make it. Everything should stay in the terminal if it can.  
- **PIX Sprite Editor Improvements**: Fully CLI sprite editor—because the mouse is overrated. Enhancing PIX to push out better sprites while staying entirely within the command line is the dream.  

### Privacy Is Safety  
Now, let’s talk **privacy**. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: **privacy IS safety**. The way I see it, if you’re serious about keeping your data safe, the first thing you do is **remove the camera** from your laptop. Seriously, yank it out and only plug one in when you actually need it. Trusting built-in cameras? That’s just a *bad call*.  

As for software, **Microsoft** is the enemy here. Their software is **spyware**, plain and simple. They bundle so much **malware** right into the core of their tools that it’s scary. Don’t even get me started on **Teams** and **Zoom**. Those apps are everything Edward Snowden warned us about. They’re nothing short of a surveillance nightmare—virtual eavesdropping tools wrapped in a friendly corporate package. If you value your freedom, avoid them like the plague.  

### Wrapping It Up  
There’s always so much to do, and not enough hours in the day. But that’s what makes this journey exciting. Whether it's games, utilities, or OS hacking, the terminal is my playground. Everything I make starts and ends in the command line—because, in the end, the simpler the tools, the better the results.

Catch you in the next one! Maybe by then, I’ll have something tangible to show for all this madness. Until then, keep coding, keep thinkering, and remember—privacy isn’t a luxury. It’s a right.  

Stay rebellious.
