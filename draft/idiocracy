Idiocracy in Disguise: When Fools Decide the Future

This isn’t democracy. It’s idiocracy with better branding.

We let the uninformed vote. 

People who can’t name a policy. 

Who confuse fiction with fact. 

Who vote on feelings, not reason. 

This is how civilizations collapse.

If you can’t pass a basic quiz on what each party stands for, 

what their candidates have done, and what they promise to do 

what are you voting for? Vibes? Memes? Rage?

An ignorant with a vote is more dangerous than a tyrant. 

At least a tyrant knows what they’re doing.

We test for licenses to drive, to practice medicine, to cut hair. 

But not to vote? Not to decide the fate of nations?

If your choices are shaped by propaganda, if you can’t separate truth from media-fed illusion, you are not qualified to vote.

There is no Democracy without wisdom.

We don’t need more voices. We need better ones.

When the informed vote, it's an democracy.
When the ignorant vote, it's an idiocracy.
