Why not support Tesla? Because the TV told you Elon Musk is a Nazi? That makes no sense. Nazis were socialists. Socialism means more government control over industry, wealth, and daily life. Elon Musk is doing the opposite. He’s reducing government involvement, promoting private innovation, and breaking state dependency. By definition, socialism is more government. By his actions, Musk is clearly not a socialist, so he cannot be a Nazi. One awkward hand gesture doesn’t change that.

People telling you what you stand for, what you support, what your opinions and values are without even knowing you or listening to you don’t deserve to know you or be listened to.

The second you start yelling, you’ve already lost the argument, even if you were right at first. It’s hard enough to stay calm when folks try to provoke you, so why hand them the win by blowing up first? Once you get aggressive, you're wrong by default. If you attack the other side, all you’re proving is that your ideas aren’t strong enough to stand on their own.

If you're protesting but can't explain why, won’t talk to anyone asking, and can't even articulate what you stand for or why, then you're not protesting. You're just throwing tantrums in the street.

Go to a Republican protest with a Democrat t-shirt and people will mostly ask you about it and talk to you about why you support your side. But go to a leftist protest with a Republican t-shirt and people will try to spit on you, insult you, and maybe even assault you. That tells you all you need to know about both sides.

Offended by everything.
Ashamed of nothing. 
Entitled to everything.
Contributing nothing.

sum it up when 

When you're so ignorant about your own beliefs that you can't even try to explain them,
you're in the deep end of nonsense.

I think it is good to keep in mind that:

Discrimination is when folks stop judging by character and actions, the only true measures of a person. No matter class, gender, or background, it's the strength of one's values and deeds that define a person's worth and nothing else.

There aren’t two versions of reality, just reality. If there were, no criminal could be judged, because every act would just be 'a matter of perspective.' Proof exists for a reason.
Those who choose no side always end up siding with the oppressor. Silence and neutrality protect the one causing harm, not the one enduring it.

I’ve seen some older folks lacking wisdom. I think hardship is what truly forges wisdom, just like pressure builds diamonds and heat shapes a blade. Without challenges, what’s there to learn from? The longer you live, the more opportunities you have to learn.

--- Friendship:

The friend who vanishes at your boundary was never standing beside you. Let false ones fall.

Better to walk alone than carry the weight of a hollow companion. Let those who value you walk beside you by choice.


The branch that breaks under weight was never strong. The friend who leaves at your truth was never true.

Those who fears your boundaries seeks to own you, not know you. Let them go.

Those who flee when you stand firm were never near.



Those who abandon you when you stand for yourself were never with you.

Those willing to lose your friendship were never worthy of it.

What is easily thrown away was never truly valued.

Those who see your worth won’t risk losing you. Only the blind let gold slip away.

I’ll let those who don’t value my contribution learn to do without it. I’ll let those who take my support for granted try to stand on their own. And those who never saw my worth? They’ll live without me.
