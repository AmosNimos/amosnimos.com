Poland's immigration policy prioritizes the safety and well-being of its citizens, effectively managing its borders and ensuring stability. While other countries struggle, Poland stands out for maintaining order and cohesion by controlling who enters its territory. In contrast, Canadaâ€™s open-door policy has led to rising challenges and discontent. Poland's approach shows that a country can thrive by safeguarding its own interests and prioritizing the needs of its citizens over unchecked immigration.
At this point letting illegal immigrants in is a slap to ones who are going through the process of legally coming to your country
we CAN'T blame Poland for protecting their country, it's like blaming someone for shooting an intruder who is trying to brake into his house

Poland prioritizes its people over those of other countries. If all countries were like that, we wouldn't need refugees! Poland is one of the safest, wealthiest, and best countries by every metric, so whatever they are doing is clearly working. However, other countries and the EU are trying to force them to take in immigrants, threatening to undermine one of the only systems that works. This feels like an attack on Poland. While Poland is doing great, many other countries are struggling. The people of Poland have the right to want to keep things working.
