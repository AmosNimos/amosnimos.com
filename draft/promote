Sometime I refresh the page after writing a youtube comment
and it's gone.

Sometimes I try to share a link to a related article
to a video I watched. trying to promote my site
organically at the same time, but these comments
are automatically deleted.

cant post on reddits page made just for that unless
you interacted with the page for a while.
